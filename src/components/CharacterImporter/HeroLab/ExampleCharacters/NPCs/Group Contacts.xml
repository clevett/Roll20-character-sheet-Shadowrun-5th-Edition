				<description>Born in the impoverished Newcastle neighborhood of Bellevue, Seattle, in 2053, Adelaide was one of five children. Her mother was a Cybernetics Scientist and her father died when she was very young, killed by organleggers. At a young age, she showed promise with computers and was recruited by Horizon out of high school to become a security spider.

She is unnaturally lucky (+2 Edge) and has a prototype Horizon tarantula drone that can do repairs on her deck. Unlike most spiders, she's an extrovert and loves to party when she's not busy with work. She does have something of a sadistic side when it comes to opponents on the Matrix... she likes to deal the pain, the more the better, and has Biofeedback running in any encounter with an intrusive hacker.

She's a bit bored working for Horizon and has and idealized perspective on Shadowrunning... its just so whiz-cool, isn't it?</description>

				<attribute name="Body" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="5"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="5.41" base="5" modified="5.41" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="9.41" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="3/5" base="3" modified="5" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Codeslinger: Data Spike">
						<description>Ones and zeroes are practically a native language to a Codeslinger. The character is adept at performing a particular Matrix action (which she selects when she selects this quality) and receives a +2 dice pool modifier to that Matrix action. This can only be selected for Matrix Actions (p. 237) that have a test associated with them.</description>
						<traitcost bp="10"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Home Ground (Digital Turf): Horizon Host">
						<description>If a character knows her neighborhood better than anyone - the shortcuts, the hiding places, and the people she can trust - then she probably has the Home Ground quality. She knows the families who live there, their stories, and what the kids who moved out are doing; she knows the streets better than GridGuide, knows things that aren't on GridGuide, and knows when GridGuide is wrong. She knows the politics of the gangs, who's running for whom and who's running from whom. But it's not just the physical streets. Depending on the character, her Home Ground quality can manifest in ways specific to who and what she is. When choosing this quality, select one of the bonuses below:

â¢ Digital Turf: This is for a decker or technomancer who has a specific host that she calls her own. She may actually own the spot, or it can be a place she frequents enough to consider home. The character receives a +2 bonus to Matrix Tests while in her Home Ground host. Bonuses from other Qualities may stack with Home Ground. If the character has not frequented this host for more than six months, she loses the Home Ground quality because she is no longer as familiar as she should be.

This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting one of the categories above each time.</description>
						<traitcost bp="10"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Impenetrable Logic">
						<description>Some would call it precognitionâthis hacker calls it quick thinking. When things in the Matrix start going sideways, they keep their cool, maintain their focus, and think their way around the problem. Which may well be some brutal IC bearing down on them.

This quality allows the character to use their Logic in place of their Willpower attribute while using Matrix Full Defense.</description>

					</quality>
				</positive>
				<negative>
					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Moderate): Mutants" rank="2">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					<quality name="SINner (Corporate Limited SIN): Horizon Group">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

Corporate Limited SIN At the 15 Karma level the character has the Corporate Limited SIN; he has somehow gained a position in a megacorporation from the outside. He may have been hired as a wageslave (or been the minor child of a person hired as a wageslave), or perhaps brought in by someone in the megacorp who saw advantage in his skill, talent, area of expertise, or some other useful attribute. Under most circumstances the Corporate Limited SIN replaces any National SIN. His Corporate Limited SIN becomes part of the Global SIN Registry, to which law enforcement agencies and security corporations alike have access. Many of these Corporate Limited SINs record whether or not the character is Awakened. The Corporate Limited SIN allows the character to be employed by the megacorp under most circumstances, and it replaces any National SIN that the character may have had previously. With the Corporate SIN, the character can be gainfully employed by the issuing megacorporation as a wageslave, a low-ranking member of the corporation's security services, or an enlisted member of the corporation's military. Though he could have a secret-level security clearance to perform his duties, he cannot rise to a leadership position, become an officer, or be part of the megacorporation's Special Forces (such as the Red Samurai). As a group, characters that possess Corporate Limited SINs are believed to either know something valuable about the inner workings of the megacorporation or have a skill set rival megacorps would want; as such they are considered valid targets for extraction, even if they are no longer active with the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Limited SIN experience prejudice and hostility from those in the shadows who are SINless. The SINless believe the corporations deliberately keep them poor and powerless so they can be exploited. The character with the Corporate Limited SIN may find himself being personally blamed for his corporation's actions - protesting he has no real authority and no connection with the actions in question usually does little good. To the SINless and neo-anarchists the character with the Corporate Limited SIN has sold out and chosen a corrupt and oppressive system over his own people. The character pays twenty percent of his gross income in taxes to his megacorporation.</description>

					<quality name="Unsteady Hands (4dicepool vs. 2)">
						<description>A character with Unsteady Hands has mild shakes that affect the dexterity and finesse in his hands. The character suffers a -2 dice pool modifier for all Agility-based tests when symptoms manifest themselves. The condition could be physiological (an untreated genetic disorder or damaged nerves, for example), caused by psychological trauma, or even be symptomatic of age. Certain augmentations or medications can mask these symptoms under normal circumstances. Under more stressful situations in the course of the run, there is a chance the Unsteady Hands condition can reappear. The character makes an Agility + Body (4) Test following a stressful encounter (combat, for example). A successful test means the character does not experience the symptoms of this condition (this time). A failed test causes the difficulties associated with unsteady hands to re-emerge, and they remain with the character for the remainder of the run.</description>

Its basic functionality is identical to a standard datajack, offering a DNI link to devices and a filter to handle some of the local interference, but the Plus offers a small cache of memory and a processor system that links up with your commlink (or cyberdeck) with the ability to run programs. The d-plus system comes in a variety of processor speeds and cache sizes to offer a variety of options for the executive with an eye on the top spot or the electronic security specialist that needs an edge because the shadows keep getting faster and more deadly.

Datajack Plus Rules
The datajack plus offers space for a number of Common and Hacking programs. When connected to a commlink or cyberdeck, the datajack plus can run a number of Common and Hacking programs equal to its rating.

						<description>Even though cyberdecks were supposedly intended only for cyber-security specialists, we knew full well the moment they hit the market, theyâd be finding their way into the hands of hackers in no time, often straight from the same corps that designed them just for their security specialists. To counter these events yet again, theyâve developed another branch of decks, designed with a locked chipset, and a specific setup that best suits their purposes. The system designs include virtually no Sleaze protocols and a generally low-grade set of processors, but they offer potential with their various levels of Firewall hardware, along with attack systems and a stringent set of program allotments that are pre-loaded and canât be changed without altering the hardware of the deck.

Security Deck Rules
All security decks come with special anti-tamper systems that brick the device if programs are changed. Changing a program block requires a Logic + Hardware [Mental] (Device Rating x 2, 1 hour) Extended Test. If any roll does not achieve any hits, the deck is bricked.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="2/6" base="2" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="0.6" base="1" modified="0.6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="4.6" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect.

					<quality name="Gearhead">
						<description>The Gearhead is who you look for when it's time to stomp on the gas and move. She's a natural-born driver or pilot. When she's at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she's controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed or the Handling of her vehicle or drone by +1 (playerâs choice) for 1D6 minutes. She also receives a +2 dice pool modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes. The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)</description>
						<traitcost bp="11"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Made Man">
						<description>As a minor member of an organized crime syndicate, the character can occasionally call on its resources. At the time of purchase, select a crime syndicate as a free Group Contact (see Group or Organization Contact Options, p. 176). As the character is an actual member of the syndicate, Loyalty is increased to 3 instead of starting at 1. This status also allows him to use the syndicate as a reliable fence for stolen goods (they get thirty percent of the items' value) or as a source for stolen and restricted goods (ten percent price reduction and a +1 dice pool modifier for the Availability Test).

Everything comes with a price, though. The character is expected to participate in syndicate work, taking at least twenty hours of his time every week in a standard campaign, and costing the character one out of every four weeks in Missions play.</description>

						<description>Whether because of your skill, charisma, determination, or just dumb luck, people to look to you for leadership when things need to get done or when operations go sideways.

					<quality name="Speed Demon">
						<description>Pushing your vehicle to its limits makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, but in a good way. You feel alive, alert, and ready to do anything. This increased intensity gives you a +1 dice pool bonus to Pilot tests for a vehicle that is moving at a speed attribute of 3 or higher (4 for aircraft). Note that your character must either be directly in the vehicle he is piloting or jacked in; the bonus does not apply to vehicles that are simply being piloted remotely.</description>

					<quality name="Addiction (Moderate): Caffeine" rank="2">
						<description>A character with the Addiction quality is hooked on chemical substances, such as street drugs (novacoke, bliss, tempo); technological or magical devices, such as better-than-life (BTL) chips or foci; or potentially addictive activities such as gambling or sex. Physiological Addictions affect the Body's functions, producing pain, nausea, shakes, and other side effects that can impair the runner, particularly during withdrawal. Some possible effects of psychological Addictions include paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, mood disorders, and depression. For specific rules on Addiction Tests, Withdrawal Tests, and staying clean, see p. 414.

The bonus Karma value of this quality depends on how severe the addiction is. Levels of addiction include: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. Each level of Addiction has a starting dosage level that tells the character how much of a substance or activity they must use for a craving to be sated. This level can be increased if the character has augmentations. The more severe a character's Addiction, the more substance or time devoted to the activity he needs to satisfy his cravings.

At the lower end of the spectrum for the Addiction quality (Mild, Moderate), it is easier to hide the effects of an Addiction. At the most severe levels (Severe, Burnout), there are noticeable physical and mental signs of Addiction. These signs negatively impact his Social Tests even if he is not suffering the effects of withdrawal.

Mild (4 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: Mild cravings occur once a month for the character. If a character fails his Withdrawal Test, he suffers symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and use the substance or engage in the activity to find relief. On a run, this could mean delaying plans that the runner team may have meticulously put together for a job, especially if the character is busy gambling with a bookie or slotting a BTL instead of being available for the run. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool modifier to all of the character's Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or to all the character's Physical-attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency). If the character succeeds on his Withdrawal Test, the character does not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need the substance or participate in that habit until the character makes their next Withdrawal Test (in one month). He is able to stay clean for that month.

Moderate (9 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: A craving at the Moderate level occurs roughly every two weeks. If the character experiences withdrawal, he suffers a -4 to all Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or -4 to all Physical- attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency) until the craving is satisfied.

Severe (20 Karma)/2 doses or 2 hours of habit-related activity: The addiction is spiraling out of control. The addict experiences cravings once a week. If he fails a Withdrawal Test, he suffers a -4 dice pool modifier to either their Mental- or Physical-based tests (as appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

In addition, he suffers a -2 dice pool modifier to all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not. It is all but impossible now for the character to hide his addiction, even when he's had his fix. The physical and psychological symptoms of the damage caused by his Addiction are readily apparent to the close observer.

Burnout (25 Karma) 3 doses/3 hours (minimum) of habit-related activity: Burnout is the final progression of the Addiction quality. The addict experiences cravings for their drug or habit of choice every day. Until they satisfy their craving with a fix, the character suffers a -6 penalty to either his Mental- or Physical- based tests (whichever one is appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

Because his Addiction is now obvious to even the most casual observer, the character suffers a -3 dice pool modifier for all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not.

The gamemaster has discretion as to whether or not she should call for Withdrawal Tests during an Addicted character's downtime, depending on to what degree the gamemaster wants the addiction to impact gameplay for the character.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					<quality name="Dependent(s) (1): Sibling" rank="1">
						<description>A character with the Dependents quality has one or more loved ones who depend on them for emotional support and financial aid. Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse or lover, a sibling, or an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a fair amount of the character's time, as well as some of the character's money. Increase the amount of time it takes to learn a new skill or improve an existing skill by fifty percent. See the Character Advancement section on p. 103 for more information on how long it takes to improve skills. Also increase the base time for any long-term projects by fifty percent. A dependent could also be a hindrance in other ways - getting underfoot, sharing living space, involving herself in the character's work, borrowing the car, calling at the most inopportune moments, etc.

For 3 Karma, the dependent is an occasional nuisance: dropping in unexpectedly (such as when the character must go to a meet), needing emotional support, favors, or other confirmations of friendship/commitment, and occasionally money. Examples of dependents at this level include: slacker sibling, long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, or a child not living with the character but for whom the character pays child support and visits regularly. Raise the character's lifestyle cost by 10 percent each month.

For 6 Karma, the dependent is a regular inconvenience: needing attention and commitment on a regular basis, getting involved in the character's affairs, sharing living space. Examples of dependents at this level include: a live-in lover/wife/husband or family member, a child for whom the character shares custody and routinely has in his home (every other weekend, etc.), or a young child or close sibling for whom the character is responsible. Increase the character's lifestyle cost by 20 percent each month.

At the 9 Karma level, the dependent is close family or a life partner and lives with the character. The dependent is a strain on the character's time and resources, and/or requires special care and attention that limits the character's availability for missions or specific actions. Examples of these dependents include large family sharing the living space, parents or grandparents with medical or physical needs, and full custody of any children. Increase the lifestyle cost for the character by 30 percent each month.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Distinctive Style: Speed Freak">
						<description>A character with the Distinctive Style quality has at least one aspect of his appearance, mannerism, or personality that makes him inconveniently memorable. Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what's distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.

Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This quality is physical in nature and does not apply to astral searches. This quality may only be taken once. This quality is incompatible with Blandness.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Prejudiced (Outspoken): Law Enforcement" rank="2">
						<description>With this quality the character is Prejudiced against members of a specific group of people: metahumans, Awakened, non-metahuman sapient critters, or some other group. The character is not merely intolerant - he is outspoken about his beliefs and may actively work against the target of his prejudice. Depending upon the degree of prejudice, this quality can get the character into trouble for expressing his views or when forced to confront the targets of his prejudice.

The Karma bonus granted by this quality varies depending upon how common the hated group is, how often the character is likely to encounter members of the group, and the degree to which the character is openly antagonistic toward them. Refer to the Prejudiced Table to determine the Karma value of the quality based on the prevalence of the hated group and the degree of prejudice.

When dealing with the target of their prejudice, a character receives a -2 dice pool modifier per level of severity of the Prejudiced quality for all Social Tests. If negotiations are a part of the encounter, the target receives a +2 modifier per level of the Prejudiced quality. So if a character who is radical in their prejudiced views against the Awakened tries to negotiate with the target of their prejudice, they receive a -6 to their Negotiation Test while the target receives a +6 dice pool modifier.

Prevalence of target group: Karma Value
Common target group (e.g, humans, metahumans): 5 Karma
Specific target group (e.g, the Awakened, technomancers, shapeshifters, aspected magicians): 3 Karma

Degree: Karma Value
Biased (e.g, closet meta-hater): 0 Karma
Outspoken (e.g, typical member of Humanis): 2 Karma
Radical (e.g, racial supremacist): 5 Karma</description>

It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it's like getting a free datajack). When you're jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Speed of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), again when you're jumped in.</description>

This accessory works with a smartgun system to give you the full benefit of the system. The smartgun will tell you the range to various targets, as well as ammunition level (and type), heat buildup, mechanical stress and so on. Without a smartlink, a smartgun system just sends out data that isn't received by anyone and has no effect.

						<description>Max Value: 100,000Â¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

						<description>Building and repairing items requires the right tools for the job.

A facility needs a building and is immobile because of the bulky and heavy machines involved, but it can be used for very advanced constructions and modifications. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

						<description>This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.</description>

				<description>Billie-Ray Katou was raised by shadowrunners who wanted a better life for her, so they scrimped and saved and got her a fake SIN to attend a good medical school in Cincinnati. Billie-Ray did well and moved back to Seattle to practice medicine. She was a tireless emergency room physician, but was often overlooked for promotion because she tended to work quietly, not drawing attention to her accomplishments.

She mostly kept her nose clean until, in 2072, she was recognized by a former associate of her parents that came in to get patched up.  He threatened to reveal she was SINless and ruin her career and, in a moment of desperation, she filled him with morphine until he died.  Unfortunately, a nurse realized what had happened and reported her.  She was arrested, found to be SINless and sent to prison for murder.  Though sentenced to 20 years, she got out in 5 due to good behavior and in recognition of her work in the prison infirmary (she also suspects her parents greased some palms).

While in prison, she became inextricably involved in the Yakuza and became a trusted medic for their soldiers inside, something she continued to do on the outside after they set her up with an underground medical facility attached to a drug processing warehouse on the docks in Tacoma. She tries not to care... she can't work professionally any more and she's terrified of becoming homeless. Besides, she's got a new family now and they'll look out for her.

She just needs to keep that temper she's developed about it all locked up tight inside, where it belongs.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

						<description>A character with the Gifted Healer quality is particularly adept at one of the three tests detailed in the Care Under Fire optional rules (Stabilization, Diagnosis, or Treatment, p. 14). She receives a +1 dice pool bonus whenever performing the selected test, whether by magical or mundane means. Gifted Healer may only be taken once, meaning a character can only get the bonus for a single test, not two or three.</description>

					<quality name="Natural Immunity: HMMHVV" rank="2">
						<description>The ability to casually sip poison can never be overrated. A character with Natural Immunity has an innate or developed immunity to one single disease or toxin.

This quality is available at two levels. If purchased at the 4 Karma level, the character is immune to a single natural disease or toxin. If Natural Immunity is purchased at the full 10 Karma level, the character is immune to a single, synthetic (artificially created) disease or toxin. Natural Immunity does not affect diseases or toxins that are magically based, such as HMHVV.

The player and gamemaster must agree on the disease, drug, or poison to which the character is immune. The character can take one dose of the drug or poison and experience one exposure to the disease every six hours with no ill effects. Any subsequent dosing or exposure during the next six hours causes normal damage, but the character's recovery time is halved.

Note that characters with Natural Immunity to a disease can be a carrier, infecting other characters while suffering no ill effects.</description>

					<quality name="Ex-Con">
						<description>Runners often brag that they'd go down in a blaze of glory before they let the pawns bring them down. The prison system is full of them. A character with this quality is fresh out of the joint and still on the legal leash, so they have several drawbacks.

First, the local police corporation has a full file and rundown on the character, including augmentations, magical training, known associates, biometric data, a material link, etc. This file is duplicated by the local prison corporation if they are different than the police force and is connected to their nice new Criminal SIN (sorry, no extra points there). Plus, the character cannot have any Restricted or Forbidden augmentations, as the prison system removes them to protect the other inmates and staff (and sell them to the black market).

Second, the character is on parole and has to check in with their parole officer (PO) twice a week via the Matrix and once a week in person. Plus, the PO can choose to make a house call any time they want. Whether the gamemaster wants the character to have a sleazy or a squeaky clean PO is up to them, but each creates their own bundle of problems.

Third, the character is known to be an ex-con and is limited in their choice of contacts. Street-level folks will still freely associate with the runner - hell, they might even commiserate while waiting in their mutual PO's waiting room. Corp contacts will only associate with the character if they have a Loyalty Rating of 4 or higher, and law enforcement contacts only stick by the runner if they have a Loyalty Rating of 5 or 6.

If the character ever gets past their parole or creates a new life for him- or herself, this quality must be bought off or replaced with other negative qualities of equal or greater value.</description>

					<quality name="SINner (Criminal SIN): UCAS" useradded="no">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

Criminal SIN At the 10 Karma level, the character has a Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National); his Criminal SIN replaces any previous SIN. At some point in his life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offense and was branded a criminal for the rest of his life. He is legally required to broadcast his Criminal SIN at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. He is shunned by law-abiding society. Law-abiding citizens will, if they must, deal with a SINless character before they'd have any interaction with a known criminal. With his Criminal SIN, the character will experience prejudiced views, suspicion, and/or open hostility from most people with SINs. He will often be denied entry to certain locations (high-end stores, car dealerships, museums, galleries, etc.) and will have difficulty finding legal employment. He can expect to be brought in and held up to 48 hours for questioning anytime a crime is committed in his area. The judicial system in 2075 is more an assembly line than institution of justice. Suspects are treated as guilty unless proven innocent, plausible circumstantial evidence is often sufficient for conviction, and sentencing has more to do with the judge's mood than the crime. In this environment it's likely the cops will be more interested in closing the case than solving any crime; they may try to pin crimes on the character with the Criminal SIN whether or not she had anything to do with it. Some degree of "adjusting" facts and "interpreting" witness accounts to support allegations is common; fabricating evidence, if only to meet conviction productivity goals, is not rare. Magic users tend to receive much harsher treatment from the judicial system than mundane criminals. If the character is a magic user with a Criminal SIN, he is registered with local law enforcement. He can expect regular - but usually not scheduled - checks to confirm he lives and to ensure he is not using forbidden spell formula, foci, or other magical gear. The nation or corporation that issued the Criminal SIN will keep close tabs on the character, if he fails to update residential information or appears in any way to be trying to evade their oversight, he is subject to arrest. He is also required to pay a fifteen percent tax on his gross income to the entity that issued his Criminal SIN.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="4/3" base="4" modified="3" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

				<attribute name="Reaction" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

				<attribute name="Strength" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="11" augmentedmaximum="16" minimum="5" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				<attribute name="Intuition" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="1.65" base="2" modified="1.65" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Sadistic">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Sadistic (8 Karma): As a child, the character bullied others and tortured small animals. As an adult, she's moved on to inflicting pain and suffering on those around her, physical and mental, whenever she has the chance. A Composure (3) Test is required to stop from inflicting some form of pain whenever the character has the reasonable chance to do so without incurring danger, even when it might interfere with her own safety, like when the team's face is trying to talk their way out of a firefight.</description>

									<description>This allows you to describe the problems this Omega-Grade augmentation has.

As an optional rule, a gamemaster may allow a player to take some kind of drawback from their used cyberware instead of 1.2 times the normal Essence cost. While there are no hard and fast rules for this, the greater the savings in Essence, the worse the flaw should be. Examples might include a smartgun link that won't fire at people flagged as Ares employees; a cyberleg with a bad knee, lowering the character's run speed multiplier by one; or wired reflexes without an off switch, resulting in a life where they strike out against perceived threats in everyday life with possibly tragic consequences. As always, the gamemaster has final say.</description>

						<item name="CAST" essencecost="0.5" useradded="no" wireless="Present">
							<description>Computer-assisted sensory translation (CAST) is the equivalent of a rigger interface for biodrones. It allows the rigger to jump in to a biodrone and not only control them through AR commands but experience the animalâs senses through a wireless connection. This technology circumvents the greatest obstacle in biodrone developmentâthe inability of traditional simsense interfaces and the metahuman mind to process an animalâs raw senses.

CAST tackles this problem by tapping the sensory centers of the animalâs cortex, allowing the biodrone to transmit real-time sensory and rigging information feeds. Identifying sensory stimuli in the brain, a CAST unit reads and translates data into comprehensible simsense data. This technique allows the rigger to make use of an animalâs enhanced senses, such as an eagleâs sharp eyesight or a bloodhoundâs enhanced sense of smell. The system can also interpret senses that metahumans normally do not possess such as a migratory birdâs direction sense or a sharkâs electromagnetic sense. Software then reinterprets this sensory data into a form that makes sense to the rigger, such as multicolored ARO overlays or icons.

The simsense data the CAST system generates is two-way. Commands from the rigger are translated into sensory experiences that trigger predictable behavior from the animal. The illusory smell of food and a sense of hunger can be projected to steer a biodrone in a certain direction. A target marked as a target by the rigger will be perceived as prey. The system may even be programmed to activate certain cues based on simple vocal commands. An advanced CAST package, available on demand, expands the CAST system with a friend-or-foe recognition system.

While much research has gone into the process, there have been no successful trials of a CAST system interpreting a paracritterâs astral sight, as there is no identified region of the brain that controls this ability.</description>

							<description>Supplemental Environmental Interaction Expert System
SEIES is a common tactical implant that ties a biodrone into a facilityâs defense network or a military unit network. The SEIES provides updated information on the location of friendlies, their firing arcs, sensor contact with the enemy, and defense installation status; when combined with an implanted commlink, CAST implant or a stirrup interface, the information is translated into simple sim-perceptions that the animal intelligence can process. If installed at a relatively young age, animals will grow up with a natural understanding of these foreign impressions. Given enough time, an animal can learn to use SEIES to manipulate its environment. It can use it to open and close doors, switch other defense systems on and off, or perform similar tasks. This amount of control allows the animal to freely move through its habitat, or in the case of an experienced predator, to reconfigure the maze it is kept in when hunting intruders. The biodrone may trigger any function linked to the network (such as an alarm, opening or closing a door) as a Free Action. Further, it may add + 2 to any Surprise Tests (including ambushing). A combat biodrone equipped with both SEIES and TRACES can use its environment to devastating effect, preparing ambushes and potentially separating team members from the rest of the group.</description>

						<item name="TRACES" essencecost="0.7" useradded="no" wireless="Present">
							<description>Tactical Recognition and Analyitical Capability Expert System
While most animals can routinely beat a computer in recognizing other animals or metahumans, they arenât able to readily identify man-made objects and their functions, be they weapons, buttons and switches, or potential recon targets. TRACES tries to solve this problem. The system employs advanced image-recognition software linked to an optical feed (typically cybereyes, or a mounted camera). TRACES then uses the implanted commlink, CAST implant, or stirrup interface to translate directions into behavioral guidance. For instance, as a recon biodrone approaches a target, TRACES identifies the intruder and either equates it with food/home/comfort (to move the drone closer), or with danger if the intent is for the biodrone to move away. The preceding example uses crude, simple impressions; by overlaying multiple complimentary impressions, quite complex behavior can be generated, effectively allowing the animal to use its own natural abilities to deal efficiently with situations that would normally be alien to it. In game terms, a TRACES-equipped biodrone can be treated like a tactically trained metahuman in regards to its behavior in combat (e.g., avoiding heavily armed opposition, staying out of firearm range, using cover, recognizing the magician and staying out of line of sight, and so forth). Further, the animal is capable of recognizing doors, simple switches, and similar features, and it understands how to use them. Note that this system works both waysâif the animal ânaturallyâ detects and identifies a threat, this information is shared with the system, which enhances its performance. TRACES also grants a biodrone + 2 dice bonus for any Melee Combat Tests and all defense tests.</description>

It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

						<description>"So sorry, Damian, I can't head out on the new Ares prototype ship with you this weekend, I have a run," is something a character with this quality might actually say. This quality gives the character an additional pool of Free Karma for purchasing contacts, with a few stipulations. First, the character gets an additional Charisma x 4 in Karma to purchase contacts. Second, none of these contacts can have a Connection Rating less than 8. Third, any leftover Karma that the character cannot spend is lost. These contacts can't be called at every turn; see the Who You Know chapter for information on what happens if the favors of contacts are abused. (p. 172).</description>

On the characterâs first Initiative Test, the character divides their Initiative Score for that Combat Turn in half (rounded up). In subsequent Combat Turns, the character may roll their normal Initiative. Combat Paralysis also gives the character a â3 dice pool modifier on Surprise Tests.

					<quality name="Dependent(s) (3): Teenage Son" rank="3">
						<description>A character with the Dependents quality has one or more loved ones who depend on them for emotional support and financial aid. Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse or lover, a sibling, or an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a fair amount of the character's time, as well as some of the character's money. Increase the amount of time it takes to learn a new skill or improve an existing skill by fifty percent. See the Character Advancement section on p. 103 for more information on how long it takes to improve skills. Also increase the base time for any long-term projects by fifty percent. A dependent could also be a hindrance in other ways - getting underfoot, sharing living space, involving herself in the character's work, borrowing the car, calling at the most inopportune moments, etc.

For 3 Karma, the dependent is an occasional nuisance: dropping in unexpectedly (such as when the character must go to a meet), needing emotional support, favors, or other confirmations of friendship/commitment, and occasionally money. Examples of dependents at this level include: slacker sibling, long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, or a child not living with the character but for whom the character pays child support and visits regularly. Raise the character's lifestyle cost by 10 percent each month.

For 6 Karma, the dependent is a regular inconvenience: needing attention and commitment on a regular basis, getting involved in the character's affairs, sharing living space. Examples of dependents at this level include: a live-in lover/wife/husband or family member, a child for whom the character shares custody and routinely has in his home (every other weekend, etc.), or a young child or close sibling for whom the character is responsible. Increase the character's lifestyle cost by 20 percent each month.

At the 9 Karma level, the dependent is close family or a life partner and lives with the character. The dependent is a strain on the character's time and resources, and/or requires special care and attention that limits the character's availability for missions or specific actions. Examples of these dependents include large family sharing the living space, parents or grandparents with medical or physical needs, and full custody of any children. Increase the lifestyle cost for the character by 30 percent each month.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Commanding Voice (6dicepool vs.  Willpower + Intuition)" name="Commanding Voice (6dicepool vs.  Willpower + Intuition)">
						<description>This power channels the adeptâs magic into his voice to enhance the modulation and pitch, subliminally influencing the actions of any listeners. The adept takes a Complex Action to give a simple but forceful command (five words or less) to the target, making an Opposed Test with Leadership + Charisma against the target(s) Willpower + Intuition. If the adept succeeds in the test, the target uses his next action to either carry out the command or stands confused (gamemasterâs choice, but the more net hits achieved the more likely it is for the target to obey the adeptâs command). Such commands carry no weight beyond the immediate impetus, and the affected characters will quickly reassert their wits, returning to their original course of action. If multiple individuals are targeted, use the largest dice pool among the defenders and add 1 die per additional target (to a maximum of six individuals). Commanding Voice may only be used on metahumans who can directly hear and understand the adeptâs words. It has no effect when the voice is amplified or broadcast via technological means (e.g., wireless transmission or loudspeaker). It is also less effective on subsequent uses against the same target. Apply a cumulative â2 dice pool penalty for each use within the preceding 24 hours.

With this power, an adept can give a target a five-word command. With magical energies empowering their words, an adept with this ability can compel a target to do almost anything, including dropping a weapon, walking out of a building, getting into a car, or remaining silent while another team member renders the target unconscious. Adepts have said that this ability can only be used on a single target a limited number of times within a twenty-four hour period or else they grow resistant to it, but all it takes is one action the adept stops or alters to make a difference in a run. This power, if used properly, can minimize opportunities for things to go wrong and minimize any violence that may be required to grab the target.</description>

The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane.

The taser, that isâshe was raging mad about being pulled over for driving while tusked. When her coworkers learned about what happened, they pondered how the HR chief is small for a troll, and they decided to up their taser game a bit. They took their shotgun-shell stun dart, which was in full production, and they figured it could shoot out of a taser just as easily.

						<description>This surprising offering from Krupp Arms is a throwback to the rare pistol used in the Confederacy during the Civil War. This pistol uses a double-barrel design with the cylinder rotating around a large central chamber that holds a single 20-gauge shotgun shell (most commonly loaded with a flechette round). A bit large for human hands with a strong kick, it fits well in larger metahuman hands. This design combined with the Kriegfaust has some speculating that Krupp may be trying to compete with Krime for the metahuman weapons market. Switching the firing mode to fire the central shotgun chamber requires a Simple Action. This function is controlled by the custom-built ammo skip system included with this model.</description>

								<description>This surprising offering from Krupp Arms is a throwback to the rare pistol used in the Confederacy during the Civil War. This pistol uses a double-barrel design with the cylinder rotating around a large central chamber that holds a single 20-gauge shotgun shell (most commonly loaded with a flechette round). A bit large for human hands with a strong kick, it fits well in larger metahuman hands. This design combined with the Kriegfaust has some speculating that Krupp may be trying to compete with Krime for the metahuman weapons market. Switching the firing mode to fire the central shotgun chamber requires a Simple Action. This function is controlled by the custom-built ammo skip system included with this model.</description>

								<description>This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social camouflage. Even when you arenât wearing the right outfit for a situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes) with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).</description>

When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

								<description>The value and status of simply wearing certain outfits help characters impress those around them, while on the other hand wearing camo fatigues at a social gathering isn't the social standard. Some pieces of armor raise the Social Limit of the wearer. These modifiers do not stack; only the highest modifier of any visible clothing item counts (and "visible" means seeing enough of it that viewers get a solid impression of what the garment does on the wearer. Seeing, for example, only the edge of a cuff poking out from under the sleeve of a battered overcoat or the hem of a dress beneath a housecoat will not provide the modifier).

						<description>Max Value: 500,000Â¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Warrior's Code (5dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>â¢ Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.

Code of Honor
The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.</description>

					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Vindictive">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Vindictive (5 Karma): Though best served cold, the thought of vengeance sure makes your blood boil. No matter how small the slight, it cannot go unreturned, and the escalation factor must always be considered. An insult may be returned with a calm threat, a threat might get the same or may require a payment in pain, and any injurious assault must be brought back upon your enemies two-fold (or more). To resist the urge for instant payback, the character must make a successful Composure (2) Test, and even when resisted, the character must add the offender's name to their hit list for the future.</description>

						<description>Whether it's redirecting bulls, snagging wrists, or lashing infidels, the whip has seen an interesting history as a tool, a showpiece, a torture device, and a weapon. This versatility is both its greatest asset and its biggest detriment. The training that is needed to use this weapon is very specific, but a truly skilled individual can perform feats with this item unmatched by any other weapon.

A whip can be used to snare handheld objects, including weapons, or to trip an opponent using the Called Shot rules (p. 195, SR5). Disarming or grabbing a held object requires a Blast Out of Hands called shot with an additional Opposed Strength Test to yank the item free and toward, instead of away from, the attacker. The attacker must be within 2 meters of the opponent and gains a +2 dice pool bonus to their Strength Test. Tripping an opponent uses the Knockdown called shot. Again, the attacker must be within 2 meters of the target.</description>

A weapon focus is effective against astral forms too, whether you're using astral perception or projection. It adds its Force to your Astral Combat Tests when you're using it, and you can take it along while astrally projecting. The damage of the weapon in astral combat is the same as it is in the physical world, except that you can decide between Stun or Physical damage (Astral Combat, p. 315).</description>

						<description>Claws. Sharp, pointy teeth. A spiked tail. Whatever form it takes, the critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane. Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S.</description>

Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case.

					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="2.5" base="3" modified="2.5" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="6.5" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<quality name="Gearhead">
						<description>The Gearhead is who you look for when it's time to stomp on the gas and move. She's a natural-born driver or pilot. When she's at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she's controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed or the Handling of her vehicle or drone by +1 (playerâs choice) for 1D6 minutes. She also receives a +2 dice pool modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes. The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Speed Demon">
						<description>Pushing your vehicle to its limits makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, but in a good way. You feel alive, alert, and ready to do anything. This increased intensity gives you a +1 dice pool bonus to Pilot tests for a vehicle that is moving at a speed attribute of 3 or higher (4 for aircraft). Note that your character must either be directly in the vehicle he is piloting or jacked in; the bonus does not apply to vehicles that are simply being piloted remotely.</description>

					<quality name="Subtle Aircraft Pilot: Pilot Aircraft">
						<description>Other riggers can be flashy or showy, but you know the value of getting your work done while appearing like part of the normal traffic - or like part of the background you're passing. When you are piloting a craft on the ground, in the water, or in the air, anyone trying to spot you gets a -2 dice pool penalty to their Perception Test to find you. This includes drones, as long as you are directly controlling them instead of letting your software for the work. This quality can be selected once for each particular Pilot skill, including the various Pilot Exotic Craft skills. The type of craft it applies to must be selected when it is purchased.

Note: You must have selected the particular Pilot skill you would like to select for this Quality.</description>

						<description>Sometimes you feel like your heart pumps 108 octane instead of simple blood. Characters with this quality have an inexplicable understanding of and connection with anything they drive. Whenever the character is in physical control of a vehicle, either through manual controls or jacked into the vehicle via cable (but not Jumped In), they gain a +1 dice pool modifier for all appropriate Pilot Skill tests and increase the Handling Rating by 1.</description>

					<quality name="Addiction (Moderate): BetaMeth" rank="2">
						<description>A character with the Addiction quality is hooked on chemical substances, such as street drugs (novacoke, bliss, tempo); technological or magical devices, such as better-than-life (BTL) chips or foci; or potentially addictive activities such as gambling or sex. Physiological Addictions affect the Body's functions, producing pain, nausea, shakes, and other side effects that can impair the runner, particularly during withdrawal. Some possible effects of psychological Addictions include paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, mood disorders, and depression. For specific rules on Addiction Tests, Withdrawal Tests, and staying clean, see p. 414.

The bonus Karma value of this quality depends on how severe the addiction is. Levels of addiction include: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. Each level of Addiction has a starting dosage level that tells the character how much of a substance or activity they must use for a craving to be sated. This level can be increased if the character has augmentations. The more severe a character's Addiction, the more substance or time devoted to the activity he needs to satisfy his cravings.

At the lower end of the spectrum for the Addiction quality (Mild, Moderate), it is easier to hide the effects of an Addiction. At the most severe levels (Severe, Burnout), there are noticeable physical and mental signs of Addiction. These signs negatively impact his Social Tests even if he is not suffering the effects of withdrawal.

Mild (4 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: Mild cravings occur once a month for the character. If a character fails his Withdrawal Test, he suffers symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and use the substance or engage in the activity to find relief. On a run, this could mean delaying plans that the runner team may have meticulously put together for a job, especially if the character is busy gambling with a bookie or slotting a BTL instead of being available for the run. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool modifier to all of the character's Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or to all the character's Physical-attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency). If the character succeeds on his Withdrawal Test, the character does not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need the substance or participate in that habit until the character makes their next Withdrawal Test (in one month). He is able to stay clean for that month.

Moderate (9 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: A craving at the Moderate level occurs roughly every two weeks. If the character experiences withdrawal, he suffers a -4 to all Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or -4 to all Physical- attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency) until the craving is satisfied.

Severe (20 Karma)/2 doses or 2 hours of habit-related activity: The addiction is spiraling out of control. The addict experiences cravings once a week. If he fails a Withdrawal Test, he suffers a -4 dice pool modifier to either their Mental- or Physical-based tests (as appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

In addition, he suffers a -2 dice pool modifier to all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not. It is all but impossible now for the character to hide his addiction, even when he's had his fix. The physical and psychological symptoms of the damage caused by his Addiction are readily apparent to the close observer.

Burnout (25 Karma) 3 doses/3 hours (minimum) of habit-related activity: Burnout is the final progression of the Addiction quality. The addict experiences cravings for their drug or habit of choice every day. Until they satisfy their craving with a fix, the character suffers a -6 penalty to either his Mental- or Physical- based tests (whichever one is appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

Because his Addiction is now obvious to even the most casual observer, the character suffers a -3 dice pool modifier for all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not.

The gamemaster has discretion as to whether or not she should call for Withdrawal Tests during an Addicted character's downtime, depending on to what degree the gamemaster wants the addiction to impact gameplay for the character.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Bi-Polar">
						<description>A character with this quality fluctuates between periods of depression, stability, and mania. During manic periods, the character gains a +1 dice pool modifier to any tests involving Agility or Reaction. At the same time, the inability to focus for extended periods of time results in a -2 dice pool modifier for tests involving Logic or Intuition. During depressive periods, the character is lethargic, unmotivated, and unable to focus. Apply a -2 dice pool modifier to any tests involving Agility, Reaction, Logic, and Intuition. During stable times, the character feels balanced and suffers no difficulties except for those they impose on themselves.

The gamemaster rolls a die to determine the character's current mental state. This roll should occur at the beginning of the game session, whenever the character gets a shift in activity (sleep, after a run, during a long stakeout, etc.), or whenever the gamemaster feels like it, but at least once per day. On a result of 1 or 2, the character is in a depressed state, on a 3 or 4 the character is in a manic state, and on a 5 or 6 the character is stable.

Medication to stabilize Bi-polar characters is available at a cost of 500 nuyen a month, but requires a prescription and a SIN (a fake SIN is, of course, a viable option). Failing to take meds for more than twelve hours results in a die roll by the gamemaster. On the street, the meds go for 100 nuyen a dose.</description>

Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what's distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.

Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This quality is physical in nature and does not apply to astral searches. This quality may only be taken once. This quality is incompatible with Blandness.</description>

It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it's like getting a free datajack). When you're jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Speed of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), again when you're jumped in.</description>

						<item name="Adrenaline Pump" essencecost="1.5" rating="2">
							<description>This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure Test (p. 152); otherwise you can trigger it as a Free Action.

While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers and don't fall unconscious, even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled. You can't rest, but the adrenaline pump's Rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for Rating x 1D6 Combat Turns (the pump can't be switched off early). When time's up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to the number of Combat Turns the pump was active (use your natural Body + Willpower to resist the damage).

After the effects end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires 1 hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated.</description>

It takes a Simple Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but a couple of Combat Turns to complete the change.</description>

								<description>This device floods the airwaves with electromagnetic jamming signals to block out wireless and radio communication. The jammer generates noise equal to its Device Rating. The area jammer affects a spherical area - its rating is reduced by 1 for every 5 meters from the center (similar to the blast rules for grenades). The directional jammer affects a conical area with a 30-degree spread - its rating is reduced by 1 for every 20 meters from the center. The jammer only affects devices (and personas on those devices) that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them. Walls and other obstacles may prevent the jamming signal from spreading or reduce its effect (gamemaster's discretion).</description>

Speed: 1 minute
Duration: (9 - Body) hours, minimum of 1 hour
Effect: +2 Reaction, +1 Intuition

A number of pseudomethamphetamine derivatives are sold as betameth. This stimulant suppresses the appetite and speeds up the user's metabolism and thought processes, making it a popular diet drug, especially among adolescents and teenagers. Characters on betameth are energetic and prone to jumpiness. When the effect wears off, the user crashes and suffers 6S damage (unresisted). Betameth users tend to suffer from attention-deficit disorders and feel unable to properly focus when not on the drug, leading to extended binges. Habitual users are often gaunt from malnutrition, which renders them susceptible to infection, especially of the teeth, gums, and mouth.</description>

					<item name="Stealth Tags" quantity="10">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Stealth Tags: A stealth tag always runs silent (p. 235) and has a Sleaze rating equal to its Device Rating. It's disguised to not look like RFID tags, which gives it an additional -2 Concealability modifier. Stealth tags are often used as a backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.</description>

						<description>This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.</description>

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="5/6" base="5" modified="6" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

				<attribute name="Reaction" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="0.38" base="0" modified="0.38" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="4.38" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

						<traitcost bp="3"/>

					<quality name="Battle Hardened (2)" rank="2">
						<description>Youâve been through and survived more combat and/or weird stuff than anyone has the right to. Because of this, the fear of battle doesnât affect you as much anymore. Gain +1 to all Composure tests while engaged in a hostile situation. This quality can be taken up to three times, increasing the modifier by 1 each time. This quality does not offer any benefit versus spells or critter powers.</description>
						<traitcost bp="4"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Guts">
						<description>When a bug spirit with dripping mandibles comes calling, the character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a +2 dice pool modifier on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.</description>

					<quality name="Perceptive Defender">
						<description>Sometimes keeping yourself alive is about staying alert and keeping an eye out for incoming trouble, about knowing what's coming before it's time to duck or dive for cover. This quality allows the character to use their Perception skill in place of their Willpower attribute while using Full Defense. Including this skill in the Defense Test means that their Mental limit also applies.</description>

					<quality name="Redliner">
						<description>Any cyberlimbs you have installed are jacked-to-the-max, with safety limits disabled and performance overclocked beyond what the warranty normally covers, and that's the way you like it. You receive +1 Strength and +1 Agility for every two full cyberarms or cyberlegs installed, up to a maximum of +2 for both attributes (sorry, no super centipede-man builds). The downside to pushing your 'ware that hard, however, is that the strain is quite damaging. You lose three Physical Condition Monitor boxes per two full cyberarms and legs installed. Normally, every cyberlimb gives you one additional box, but with this quality, after two full limbs you end up with net one less box (i.e., -1 instead of +2).</description>

					<quality name="Resistance to Toxins">
						<description>A character with Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins can fight off diseases and drugs more easily than other characters and receives a +1 dice pool modifier to Resistance Tests. This quality comes at two levels: at 4 Karma the character is resistant to either pathogens or toxins, not both. If the character purchases this quality at 8 Karma, she receives the +1 modifier for resisting both.</description>

					<quality name="Aged (50-59)" rank="1">
						<description>Aged characters have been around the block a time or two and lived to tell about it. They have made mistakes, but they were tough, smart, or just plain lucky enough to survive them. For each decade of life at age 50 or above, a character with the Aged quality gains 5 build points or 7 Karma (+5 or +7 for ages 50-59, +10 or +14 for ages 60-69, +15 or +21 for ages 70+). Additionally, for each decade of age, the character gains 5 bonus points worth of Knowledge skills, but his physical attribute maximums, including the maximum augmented attributes, are each reduced by 1. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may face bonuses or penalties to certain social interactions, due to people's biases and prejudices about his advanced age. Note that this quality may only be taken at character creation.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-7"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Bad Rep">
						<description>A character with a Bad Rep quality has a dark and lasting stain on her reputation. She may be a former Knight Errant cop known to have been particularly brutal in dealing with shadowrunners. Or word on the street might be that she once killed a member of her own runner team. If she's Awakened and comes from a polluted region, it may be generally accepted that she's a toxic shaman. Whether she is actually guilty of any wrongdoing is not relevant. What people believe she has done has permanently tainted the way they see her and how they deal with her. Whatever the reason, the character starts play with 3 points of Notoriety (p. 372) that can only be removed or decreased by confronting and resolving the source of the bad reputation. Only then may the Bad Rep quality be bought off with Karma.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-7"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Code of Honor: Bounty Hunter's Code (8dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.

The Code of Honor can take other forms as well. For example:
â¢ Assassin's Creed: A character never kills anyone that they are not paid to kill. Being precise as an assassin, not leaving collateral damage, and being invisible are important hallmarks of those who believe in the Assassin's Creed. Characters who take this version of Code of Honor lose 1 point of Karma for every unintentional and/or unpaid murder they commit, and their Public Awareness goes up by 1 for each such death.
â¢ Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-15"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Consummate Professional">
						<description>The consummate professional knows that the assassin contract involves a great deal of trust between both parties, and he seeks to honor that trust to the fullest. He will never talk about the jobs he takes, even to boost his own reputation. This makes him somewhat more difficult for employers to track down, but those who do find him know that they can trust him not to sell them out.

Advantages: The consummate professional has proven he's worthy of being treated better than a typical assassin. Gain a +2 Dice Pool bonus to social interaction rolls when interacting with employers.

Disadvantages: The flip side to having as much discretion as the consummate professional does is that it's much harder to be known for your work. Divide total Karma by 20 (instead of 10 as normal) and round down in order to determine Street Cred.</description>

As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), again when you're jumped in.</description>

							<description>In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and - torsos are included in the "cyberlimbs" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.

Cyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.

Cyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.

Customization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.

Cyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.

Obvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

Synthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.</description>

									<description>This accessory must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you. The effects are identical to a gyro stabilization system (p. 432), only with Rating 3 (this effect is not cumulative with a worn gyro stabilization system). Activating or deactivating the system is a Simple Action.

Gyro Mount
This heavy upper-body harness features an attached, articulated, motorized gyro-stabilized arm that mounts an assault rifle or a heavy weapon. The system neutralizes up to 6 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Simple Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about five minutes, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Complex Action.</description>

									<description>For decades, cyberlimbs have been modified and analyzed, producing results that are greater in one area at a small cost in other areas, a general tradeoff that's been largely accepted in the name of efficiency. Primarily, this market is in the fields of sports or entertainment, but new arenas are always being explored. In each case, this requires a full cyberlimb dedicated to the cause, and they're usually intended to be taken in pairs for maximum result. As you might imagine, a limb may only be optimized in one way.

Optimized limbs raise the user's applicable limit by +1 for each limb optimized in that skill. For each pair of limbs optimized for the skill, the user gains +1 to their applicable skill dice pool as well. While the list below showcases several examples, it is by no means exhaustive, and gamemasters are encouraged to come up with several of their own.

							<description>This cybersnout enhances, identifies, and records smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you - you'll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scenthound would. You can smell people's emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker's mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds - the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. The olfactory booster can even be used in VR to create an even more immersive experience. Add the booster's rating as a dice pool modifier to your scent-based Perception Tests.</description>

Removing the smartlink and the associated features like electronic safety and clip ejection, and shifting everything back to traditional mechanical mechanisms with the exception of a holographic sight (p. 181). The worst a hacker can do is make you slightly less accurate with this gun and that appeals to a lot of the less technologically minded consumers. While production numbers are currently significantly smaller than its competitors, it is still readily available and a common sight on the streets.</description>

							<item name="Fuzzy Rounds" quantity="10">
								<description>Sick of getting hacked while you only have a vague idea of where the hacker is? Or maybe you know exactly where she is and you really want to mess with her day? Keep a clip of fuzzy rounds around.

Fuzzy rounds are designed to create a burst of localized noise. Itâs like a short-range, short-term, potentially high-powered jammer. Each round has a burst emitter that is randomly programmed. The more rounds you put in an area, the more Matrix clutter you create. Great in those ammo-spitting automatics!

Standard ammunition for small arms and rifles only has a narrow range of two meters or so, but bulky heavy pistol rounds as well as shotgun slugs can push the burst out to about five meters if used correctly.

Similar to some of the other rounds weâre discussing here, fuzzy rounds have low power loads and thus lose some range, as they need to fly slower and hit softer in order to be effective.

Fuzzy Round Rules
Fuzzy rounds use Light Pistol ranges and create a narrow area of Noise. The modifier is +1 Noise per round, cumulative, and it lasts for 2 Combat Turns.

The Area is determined by the type of round and the attack roll. When attacking a location, the Area of Effect is a radius of 1m/net hit with the maximum AoE based on ammo type. When attacking a target that can avoid the attack, the Area of Effect is the same, but that pocket of Noise moves with them for the duration with a successful hit.

Suppressive fire can cover a targeted area (a line of the firerâs choosing). The attack roll and line length determines the Noise modifier, spreading the +20 evenly over the affected zone. Targets within the line that get hit are affected as above and decrease the overall number of rounds for the affected zone, decreasing the +20 by 1 per target hit.

As mentioned in the flavor text, glitches can cancel some effectiveness or even crack rounds in the gun and affect the shooter as powdered bullets spray into the air around them.

Type: Max AOE, Cost (10 rounds)
Light Pistol, Machine Pistol, Assault Rifle: 2m, 30
Heavy Pistol, SMG, Shotgun: 5m, 50
Avail 10R and 12R, respectively.</description>

								<description>As if catching a bullet wasn't bad enough, these babies make you worry about getting tracked like a wild animal afterwards.

Tracker rounds include an RFID tag inside the bullet. If the target is damaged by the hit, the tracker round remains within the body of the target until it is removed. If all damage is resisted, the round is imbedded in the target's armor. On a Grazing Hit, roll the attacking character's Edge. A single hit means the tracker imbeds in the armor; no hits means the shooter will be tracking the movements of the nearby pavement.

Tracker rounds contain either security or stealth tags (see p. 440, SR5).</description>

						<description>Sometimes, when a maglock pass key or a lock pick just canât get the job done, a more robust method becomes necessary. Popular with entry teams, battering rams range from hunks of metal to high-tech wireless devices. Battering rams are not recommended for use as a melee weapon but can be used as such (use Exotic Melee Weapon (Battering Rams) skill, assuming you had the foresight to select it). Battering rams use Strength + Agility for the attack test (see Destroying Barriers, p.197, SR5).

Fluid-Motion Ram: The same as the standard battering ram, but it includes an internal ten-liter liquid reservoir. When used, the ram is swung backwards and then forward to strike the target. On impact the internal fluid in the ram creates extra momentum that increases the impact damage. Very useful against more durable doors, but using it requires two average-size humans or one average-size troll.

*Strength Rating to be used is (combined Strength of all users) / (number of users) </description>

					<item name="Neijia" useradded="no" quantity="1" natural="yes">
						<description>Neijia means internal strength. Itâs as close as a mundane can get to magical weaponry in fighting spirits. The technique focuses the spiritual and mental strength of the character in order to inflict damage to a Materialized spirit as an Attack of Will. It allows the character to perform a physical version of Astral Combat (p. 315, SR5) against Materialized spirits. The style of the attack is based on Tai Chiâs soft and fluid motion and mental discipline. The character must first make a successful Touch Attack against the spirit. This can include a Grapple or Clinch, but it also counts if the character has been Engulfed. Using only Willpower vs. Willpower as an attack, the character can impose Charisma + net hits in Stun Damage that the spirit must resist. This damage is not physical, so it cannot be used to take down wards or magical barriers. The character feels drained after making this attack, resisting Stun Damage equal to hits (not net hits) from the spirit defending against the attack. If they are a mage they resist Drain per their tradition; everyone else uses Willpower + Charisma.</description>

					<item name="SA Retiarius XL Net Gun" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This weapon comes in two models, the basic and the XL. The basic is designed for metahumans, except for trolls, and smaller critters; while the XL is intended for trolls and other larger creatures.

When a target is hit, apply the rules for nets (see p. 25):
With a successful attack using rules for a Grazing Hit (p. 173, SR5), the net lands over an opponent and they are considered to be in subduing combat (p. 195, SR5). An attacker must move to the target in order to engage in any of the Subduing actions.

To break free of the net, the subdued character rolls Agility + Unarmed Combat (rather than Strength + Unarmed Combat) or Agility + Escape Artist as a Complex Action, against a threshold equal to the attacker's net hits.

If a large net is used against a normal sized target, the target receives a -2 modifier on his Agility, while a large target hit by a normal sized net receives a +2 Agility modifier. Net guns use light pistol ranges and cannot mount any accessories.</description>

						<description>For a quarter of a century now, cyber-implant melee weapons have been the classic, favored toys of razor guys, from street muscle to professional urban samurai. They are available as cyberarm upgrades, but can also be installed directly into the flesh. Cyber weapons can be readied via muscle flexture, neural impulse, or wireless signal. Attacks with cyber melee weapons use Unarmed Combat skill and the Physical limit.

The shock hand is like a shock glove built into the palm of your hand, perfect for inflicting a nasty shock to anything it comes into contact with. Shock hands deal Electricity damage (p. 170) and have ten charges in each hand; when plugged in they recharge at a rate of one charge per ten seconds.</description>

					<item name="Cyber Arm, Left" essencecost="1" quantity="1" wireless="Present">
						<description>In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and - torsos are included in the "cyberlimbs" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.

Cyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.

Cyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.

Customization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.

Cyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.

Obvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

Synthetic cyberlimbs: Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.</description>

								<description>This accessory must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you. The effects are identical to a gyro stabilization system (p. 432), only with Rating 3 (this effect is not cumulative with a worn gyro stabilization system). Activating or deactivating the system is a Simple Action.

Gyro Mount
This heavy upper-body harness features an attached, articulated, motorized gyro-stabilized arm that mounts an assault rifle or a heavy weapon. The system neutralizes up to 6 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Attaching or removing a weapon from the mount takes a Simple Action. Putting on a gyro-mount harness takes about five minutes, while the quick-release allows you to get out of it with a Complex Action.</description>

They are available as cyberarm upgrades, but can also be installed directly into the flesh. Cyber weapons can be readied via muscle flexture, neural impulse, or wireless signal. Attacks with cyber melee weapons use Unarmed Combat skill and the Physical limit.

					<item name="Cyber Arm, Right" essencecost="1" quantity="1" wireless="Present">
						<description>In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and - torsos are included in the "cyberlimbs" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and - feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.

Cyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost {in brackets}. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don't have cyberweapons installed - their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.

Cyberlimbs: These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.

Customization: You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost. If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.

Cyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.

Obvious cyberlimbs: These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature.

							<item name="Cyberlimb Optimization, The Greatest" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
								<description>For decades, cyberlimbs have been modified and analyzed, producing results that are greater in one area at a small cost in other areas, a general tradeoff that's been largely accepted in the name of efficiency. Primarily, this market is in the fields of sports or entertainment, but new arenas are always being explored. In each case, this requires a full cyberlimb dedicated to the cause, and they're usually intended to be taken in pairs for maximum result. As you might imagine, a limb may only be optimized in one way.

Optimized limbs raise the user's applicable limit by +1 for each limb optimized in that skill. For each pair of limbs optimized for the skill, the user gains +1 to their applicable skill dice pool as well. While the list below showcases several examples, it is by no means exhaustive, and gamemasters are encouraged to come up with several of their own.

Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Armorer shop, a Disguise kit, a Nautical Mechanic facility, etc.). A facility needs a building and is immobile because of the bulky and heavy machines involved, but it can be used for very advanced constructions and modifications. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

The directional jammer affects a conical area with a 30-degree spread - its rating is reduced by 1 for every 20 meters from the center. The jammer only affects devices (and personas on those devices) that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them.

					<item name="Mystic Restraints (Cuffs)" rating="3" quantity="1">
						<description>For confining petty Awakened criminals, law-enforcement officers use cuffs and hoods that distract the incarcerated with lights and sounds or use electric shock to keep twitchy fingers in line. For the hardened criminal magicians, however, police use individually tailored mystic restraints. The shape of these restraints acts like acupuncture that restricts the magician's access to magic. Mystic restraints (cuffs, masks, or jackets) have to be crafted with the Artificing skill, using the same Force requirements as crafting a symbolic link. Permanently creating the restraint requires 1 Karma.

Net hits from the Artificing Test determine the Force of the restraint, and the Force of the restraint reduces the Magic rating of the Awakened individual (including adepts). Adepts restrained this way temporarily lose Power Points associated with Magic loss; they may choose which powers are affected. There are many pressure points to use, but each restraint is limited to how much Magic it can it restrain. While restraints are made for a specific individual, an existing restraint can be attuned to another individual, but it will be half as effective. This requires an Intuition + Magic (5, 1 hour) Extended Test and requires either assensing the subject or having a material link of the subject to be used in attuning the restraints.

Mystic cuffs are made of steel or titanium and can have a maximum Force of 8; they are ineffective if the subject has one or more cyberarms. Masks are made of steel and leather or ceramic and have a maximum Force of 12. Similar to a straitjacket, a mystic jacket can have embedded brass studs on the inside and woven symbols on the outside. A mystic jacket can have a Force up to 18.

If the subject has the Flux metamagic (p. 150), he can reduce the effectiveness of the mystic restraints by his initiate grade while his aura is in flux.</description>

					<item name="Stealth Tags" quantity="10">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Stealth Tags: A stealth tag always runs silent (p. 235) and has a Sleaze rating equal to its Device Rating. It's disguised to not look like RFID tags, which gives it an additional -2 Concealability modifier. Stealth tags are often used as a backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

				<attribute name="Reaction" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>

					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers.

					<quality name="Home Ground (Street Politics): Tacoma">
						<description>If a character knows her neighborhood better than anyone - the shortcuts, the hiding places, and the people she can trust - then she probably has the Home Ground quality. She knows the families who live there, their stories, and what the kids who moved out are doing; she knows the streets better than GridGuide, knows things that aren't on GridGuide, and knows when GridGuide is wrong. She knows the politics of the gangs, who's running for whom and who's running from whom. But it's not just the physical streets. Depending on the character, her Home Ground quality can manifest in ways specific to who and what she is. When choosing this quality, select one of the bonuses below:

â¢ Street Politics: This character knows the street gangs, the criminal operations, and the beneath- the-surface affiliations that are the social and political fabric of her Home Ground. She receives a +2 dice pool modifier for Knowledge Tests relating to gangs or their operations.

This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting one of the categories above each time.</description>

					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers.

					<quality name="Dealer Connection (Ground Craft)">
						<description>At some point in your wide travels and extra-legal activities, you met someone who has access to retail vehicles, and your connection means that you get vehicles at a discount. When selecting this quality, pick a class of vehicle (ground craft, watercraft, aircraft, or drones). Each time you purchase a vehicle of that class, you receive ten percent off the price. The discount is taken after the gamemaster makes adjustment to the price based on Availability. This quality may be taken up to four times, once for each class of vehicle.</description>

					<quality name="Grease Monkey">
						<description>When you were young, you would much rather make a trip to the junkyard than the toy store (possibly because kids in the barrens never have enough money to buy anything at the toy store). As you got older, the allure or discarded vehicle and machine parts on the heaps in junkyards was far stronger than the promise of some new toy. You not only loved monkeying around with these items, but you could often get the devices to work. Gain +1 dice on any skill test using skills from the Engineering skill group.</description>

						<description>Who, me? Whether you sold bad cars to old ladies or spent a whole lot of time looking in the mirror getting ready for Friday night poker, you sure donât look like a liar, particularly when you are lying. This doesnât make you look innocent â just without guile. Good for selling lunar real estate. Better for convincing the interrogator you really donât know anything else. 

Whenever someone makes a Judge Intentions test against you, you receive a +2 dice pool modifier to the opposing Charisma + Willpower test.</description>

					<quality name="Juryrigger">
						<description>Juryrigger gives a character an intuitive grasp of the inner workings and underlying principles of mechanical and electronic devices. She knows how to repair the broken, rejuvenate the worn, improve a device's efficiency, or coax it into doing things it's designers hadn't intended. Characters with the Juryrigger quality receive a +2 dice pool modifier for Technical skil Tests (p. 143) when juryrigging gear. If the gamemaster decides what the character wants to accomplish is in fact possible, he determines the threshold for her success using the Build/ Repair Table (p. 146) as a guideline, then reduces the threshold for the test by 1. While a successful Mechanics Skill Test enables the Juryrigger to perform amazing technical feats, everything she devises is temporary. Examples of what a character may be able to do with Juryrigger include:
â¢ Juryrig a destroyed device so that it will operate just one more time (for 1D6 minutes).
â¢ Tweak an electronic device to function at a rating one higher than normal for 1D6 Combat Turns.
â¢ For 1D6 minutes, coax extra performance from a vehicleâs or droneâs components, increasing its Sensor or Handling by +1 (if combined with bonuses from Gearhead, the vehicleâs or droneâs critical components completely burn out at the end of the duration from being pushed well beyond their limits; at that point, the vehicle or drone becomes a big paperweight).
â¢ Improvise a one-shot device or weapon from disparate components (the gamemaster has final say on whether suitable parts are available).
â¢ Devise an impromptu means to bypass a security measure, such as a trip beam or pressure plate.</description>

					<quality name="Addiction (Moderate): Opium" rank="2">
						<description>A character with the Addiction quality is hooked on chemical substances, such as street drugs (novacoke, bliss, tempo); technological or magical devices, such as better-than-life (BTL) chips or foci; or potentially addictive activities such as gambling or sex. Physiological Addictions affect the Body's functions, producing pain, nausea, shakes, and other side effects that can impair the runner, particularly during withdrawal. Some possible effects of psychological Addictions include paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, mood disorders, and depression. For specific rules on Addiction Tests, Withdrawal Tests, and staying clean, see p. 414.

The bonus Karma value of this quality depends on how severe the addiction is. Levels of addiction include: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. Each level of Addiction has a starting dosage level that tells the character how much of a substance or activity they must use for a craving to be sated. This level can be increased if the character has augmentations. The more severe a character's Addiction, the more substance or time devoted to the activity he needs to satisfy his cravings.

At the lower end of the spectrum for the Addiction quality (Mild, Moderate), it is easier to hide the effects of an Addiction. At the most severe levels (Severe, Burnout), there are noticeable physical and mental signs of Addiction. These signs negatively impact his Social Tests even if he is not suffering the effects of withdrawal.

Mild (4 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: Mild cravings occur once a month for the character. If a character fails his Withdrawal Test, he suffers symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and use the substance or engage in the activity to find relief. On a run, this could mean delaying plans that the runner team may have meticulously put together for a job, especially if the character is busy gambling with a bookie or slotting a BTL instead of being available for the run. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool modifier to all of the character's Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or to all the character's Physical-attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency). If the character succeeds on his Withdrawal Test, the character does not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need the substance or participate in that habit until the character makes their next Withdrawal Test (in one month). He is able to stay clean for that month.

Moderate (9 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: A craving at the Moderate level occurs roughly every two weeks. If the character experiences withdrawal, he suffers a -4 to all Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or -4 to all Physical- attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency) until the craving is satisfied.

Severe (20 Karma)/2 doses or 2 hours of habit-related activity: The addiction is spiraling out of control. The addict experiences cravings once a week. If he fails a Withdrawal Test, he suffers a -4 dice pool modifier to either their Mental- or Physical-based tests (as appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

In addition, he suffers a -2 dice pool modifier to all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not. It is all but impossible now for the character to hide his addiction, even when he's had his fix. The physical and psychological symptoms of the damage caused by his Addiction are readily apparent to the close observer.

Burnout (25 Karma) 3 doses/3 hours (minimum) of habit-related activity: Burnout is the final progression of the Addiction quality. The addict experiences cravings for their drug or habit of choice every day. Until they satisfy their craving with a fix, the character suffers a -6 penalty to either his Mental- or Physical- based tests (whichever one is appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

Because his Addiction is now obvious to even the most casual observer, the character suffers a -3 dice pool modifier for all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not.

The gamemaster has discretion as to whether or not she should call for Withdrawal Tests during an Addicted character's downtime, depending on to what degree the gamemaster wants the addiction to impact gameplay for the character.

					<quality name="Combat Paralysis">
						<description>A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat; this includes astral combat and cybercombat. On the characterâs first Initiative Test, the character divides their Initiative Score for that Combat Turn in half (rounded up). In subsequent Combat Turns, the character may roll their normal Initiative. Combat Paralysis also gives the character a â3 dice pool modifier on Surprise Tests. If the character must make a Composure Test while under fire or in a similar combat situation, the gamemaster applies a +1 threshold modifier.

						<description>The Narcoject-brand dart pistol has gone through a thorough redesign since its heyday in the 2050s. Its smaller, sleeker features belie the research and craftsmanship that make this newer model so special. The main difference between Narcojectâs pistol and that of their competitor, Parashield, is that Narcoject has purposely designed their gun to have the look and feel of a light pistol, rather than the clunky dart guns of the past, which required special training to use. Most dart weapons can use other toxins, but the Narcoject One only uses Narcojectâs patented darts, and therefore cannot employ any other toxins.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Initiate Grade" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians and adepts will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation allows a character to wield greater magical abilities known as metamagic, access the metaplanes of astral space (p. 191), and raise her Magic attribute beyond her natural maximum of 6. Only characters with the Magician, Adept, or Mystic Adept qualities may initiate. Initiation is a serious process that requires a great deal of mental and spiritual preparation in the form of rituals or study appropriate to the character's tradition. A mage might spend months in research on a particular point of magic, writing a scholarly thesis in order to prepare, while a shaman might undergo a vision quest and seek guidance from her mentor spirit.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character's first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way.

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Karma points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.

A character's initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character's Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.</description>

					<quality name="Brand Loyalty: Ares">
						<description>Brand loyalty is taken to extremes in the Sixth World with individuals brainwashed by their megacorporate masters, especially when it comes to firearms. But sometimes being loyal to a brand can be a good thing. Characters who are brand loyal know the products of their favorite brand inside and out. The quality has two levels; Manufacturer and Product. At the Manufacturer level, characters choose a corporate or manufacturer brand, i.e. Ares, Saeder-Krupp, Krime, H&amp;K, Novatech, etc., and gain a +1 dice pool bonus on every roll involving gear made by their manufacturer. At the Product level the bonus is only conveyed on a single item, i.e. Predator IV, S-K-Bentley Concordat, Krime Kannon, HK227, Novatech Airware, etc.

On the downside, due to this narrow focus the character suffers a -1 dice pool penalty whenever working with a piece of gear not made by their preferred Manufacturer. At the Product level the -1 dice pool penalty is applied to all products of the same type, i.e., heavy pistols, cars, SMGs, assault cannons, commlinks, etc.</description>

					<quality name="Addiction (Mild): Sex" rank="1">
						<description>A character with the Addiction quality is hooked on chemical substances, such as street drugs (novacoke, bliss, tempo); technological or magical devices, such as better-than-life (BTL) chips or foci; or potentially addictive activities such as gambling or sex. Physiological Addictions affect the Body's functions, producing pain, nausea, shakes, and other side effects that can impair the runner, particularly during withdrawal. Some possible effects of psychological Addictions include paranoia, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, mood disorders, and depression. For specific rules on Addiction Tests, Withdrawal Tests, and staying clean, see p. 414.

The bonus Karma value of this quality depends on how severe the addiction is. Levels of addiction include: Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Burnout. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. Each level of Addiction has a starting dosage level that tells the character how much of a substance or activity they must use for a craving to be sated. This level can be increased if the character has augmentations. The more severe a character's Addiction, the more substance or time devoted to the activity he needs to satisfy his cravings.

At the lower end of the spectrum for the Addiction quality (Mild, Moderate), it is easier to hide the effects of an Addiction. At the most severe levels (Severe, Burnout), there are noticeable physical and mental signs of Addiction. These signs negatively impact his Social Tests even if he is not suffering the effects of withdrawal.

Mild (4 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: Mild cravings occur once a month for the character. If a character fails his Withdrawal Test, he suffers symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and use the substance or engage in the activity to find relief. On a run, this could mean delaying plans that the runner team may have meticulously put together for a job, especially if the character is busy gambling with a bookie or slotting a BTL instead of being available for the run. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool modifier to all of the character's Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or to all the character's Physical-attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency). If the character succeeds on his Withdrawal Test, the character does not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need the substance or participate in that habit until the character makes their next Withdrawal Test (in one month). He is able to stay clean for that month.

Moderate (9 Karma)/1 dose or 1 hour of habit-related activity: A craving at the Moderate level occurs roughly every two weeks. If the character experiences withdrawal, he suffers a -4 to all Mental-attribute-based tests (if psychological dependency) or -4 to all Physical- attribute-based tests (if physiological dependency) until the craving is satisfied.

Severe (20 Karma)/2 doses or 2 hours of habit-related activity: The addiction is spiraling out of control. The addict experiences cravings once a week. If he fails a Withdrawal Test, he suffers a -4 dice pool modifier to either their Mental- or Physical-based tests (as appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

In addition, he suffers a -2 dice pool modifier to all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not. It is all but impossible now for the character to hide his addiction, even when he's had his fix. The physical and psychological symptoms of the damage caused by his Addiction are readily apparent to the close observer.

Burnout (25 Karma) 3 doses/3 hours (minimum) of habit-related activity: Burnout is the final progression of the Addiction quality. The addict experiences cravings for their drug or habit of choice every day. Until they satisfy their craving with a fix, the character suffers a -6 penalty to either his Mental- or Physical- based tests (whichever one is appropriate for their dependency) while in withdrawal.

Because his Addiction is now obvious to even the most casual observer, the character suffers a -3 dice pool modifier for all Social Tests, whether he is in withdrawal or not.

The gamemaster has discretion as to whether or not she should call for Withdrawal Tests during an Addicted character's downtime, depending on to what degree the gamemaster wants the addiction to impact gameplay for the character.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Warrior's Code (2dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>â¢ Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.

Code of Honor
The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.</description>

					<quality name="SINner (National SIN): CAS">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

National SIN At the 5 Karma level, the character has what is called a National SIN. The character's parents were legal citizens of a nation (such as the UCAS or CAS) and he has been a citizen of that nation from birth. He has the right to vote, qualify for passports issued by his nation, enlist in the national military, or work in the national government. A National SIN is required for any national security clearance or any form of national military career. A character with a National SIN pays fifteen percent of their gross income in taxes. He is also in no way connected to any of the megacorporations. The main drawback to having a legal National SIN is the character is in the system. The nation in the player character's background has the character's biometric data (DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans) on file, and that biometric data is shared with law enforcement agencies through the Global SIN Registry. This makes it much easier to track a character should a job go sideways. Also, nations typically sell the personal information tied to the character's SIN to corporations. Those with a legal SIN get nearly three times as much spam as those who don't have a SIN or rely on fake SINs, and the spam messages they receive are disturbingly tailored to their preferences (based on their buying and browsing habits).</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink.

If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test.

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

								<description>The goal of this system is to avoid those situations where your mates are chewing you out for accidentally shooting them in the hoop. Using information about your teammates' appearance and the electronics in their PAN, this system attempts to recognize when you are aiming at any spot within 1 meter of a friendly target. In these situations, the system locks the trigger, preventing you from firing. Once the friendly target isn't at risk anymore, you can start firing again. Note that the system interprets risk broadly - if there is something between you and a friendly target, the system will lock you out, unless that "something" is an entire office building or Mt. Rushmore or something.

The basic system can mark up to 10 RFID profiles (or GPS coordinates if you want to designate fixed locations as "safe"); for a few extra nuyen you can add more profiles. If you want a little more accuracy, allowing you to easily shoot the drekhead who stole your buddy's commlink without difficulty, then upgrade to the image recognition system. You'll need a guncam or smartlink to use this function. The base image recognition allows you to enter up to 10 different visual profiles, which can be as broad as "anyone wearing the Ancients' logo" or as narrow as precise scans of members of your team. As with the GPS/RFID system, you can spring for extra profiles if you need them.

The safe target system can be mounted on any location besides the stock.</description>

								<description>Items that are Custom Fit were measured for a specific person. They are specially designed for that person and don't fit well on anyone else, therefore conferring none of the positive Social Limit adjustments to the character. When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they're used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case.

Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle.

Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers.

						<description>Claws. Sharp, pointy teeth. A spiked tail. Whatever form it takes, the critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane. Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S.</description>

					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

					<description>Your Attack rating reflects the programs and utilities you have running on your deck that inject harmful code into other operating systems, or use brute-force algorithms to break encryptions and protections to lay the virtual smackdown. Attack software is high-risk, high-reward, because firewall protocols tend to treat it harshly, doing damage that could hurt your persona if you blow it. Attack actions are good for making quick break-ins, damaging devices, and dealing with Matrix threats in a very fast but loud way.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers.

				<attribute name="Depth" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Depth is the special attribute that represents an AI's inherent ability to emulate and manipulate Matrix devices.

When creating an AI with the Priority system or Sum to Ten, the AI chooses a starting Depth rating from the chart below. An AI created using the Karma build system starts with a Depth of 1. All of the advanced programs listed below depend on an AI's Depth attribute, as it performs the Emulate action. This attribute also serves as the maximum for an AI's Edge attribute. Depth can be improved with Special Attribute Points during character creation or with Karma. The Karma cost for improving Depth is 10 + (5 x new rating). The maximum rating for an AI's Depth at character creation is 6. During or after character creation, the character may purchase the Exceptional Entity quality to remove this maximum, but that simply allows for future growth. It does not allow the character to increase Depth beyond 6 at character creation.

AIs can learn a number of programs equal to their Depth + Essence.</description>

					<quality name="Home Ground (Digital Turf): Facade">
						<description>If a character knows her neighborhood better than anyone - the shortcuts, the hiding places, and the people she can trust - then she probably has the Home Ground quality. She knows the families who live there, their stories, and what the kids who moved out are doing; she knows the streets better than GridGuide, knows things that aren't on GridGuide, and knows when GridGuide is wrong. She knows the politics of the gangs, who's running for whom and who's running from whom. But it's not just the physical streets. Depending on the character, her Home Ground quality can manifest in ways specific to who and what she is. When choosing this quality, select one of the bonuses below:

â¢ Digital Turf: This is for a decker or technomancer who has a specific host that she calls her own. She may actually own the spot, or it can be a place she frequents enough to consider home. The character receives a +2 bonus to Matrix Tests while in her Home Ground host. Bonuses from other Qualities may stack with Home Ground. If the character has not frequented this host for more than six months, she loses the Home Ground quality because she is no longer as familiar as she should be.

This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting one of the categories above each time.</description>

					<quality name="Lucky" useradded="no">
						<description>The dice roll and the coin flips this character's way more often than not, giving her the chance to drop jaws in amazement at her good fortune. Lucky allows a character to possess an Edge attribute one point higher than his metatype maximum (for example, a human character could raise her Edge to 8). Note that taking this quality does not actually increase the character's current Edge rating, it just allows her the opportunity to do so; the Karma cost for gaining the extra point must still be paid. This quality may only be taken once and must be approved by the gamemaster. The Lucky quality cannot be combined with Exceptional Attribute.

This quality decreases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

A little localized reset saves your bacon. Just like that. What are the odds, neh? Maybe GOD is on your side? That can't beâyou must just be that good.

As a Free Action, the character can spend 1 point of Edge to remove all marks a single opponent has on him. Note that in cases where other targets were sharing marks with your target, such as IC in a host, the others also lose their marks.</description>

The information read is not memorized (unless the character also possesses the Photographic Memory quality, p. 76, SR5, which allows a test for anything in the book after it is read), but the reader can gain a basic understanding of the contents. If attempting to locate a specific piece of information, phrase, or subject while in the process of reading, the character can attempt a Logic + Intuition Extended Test with a threshold and interval determined by the gamemaster based on the length of the text, its complexity, and the obscurity of the information being sought.</description>

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Nationalist: Shiawase Loyalist (6dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>Nationalist (Country): The character has an unwavering belief in the rightness of his country's policies, and seeks to advance its agenda even if it would hinder his current goals. The character loses 1 Karma per agent of the government they kill, including contractors, or knowingly allow to be killed, even in self-defense. Note that nationalism does not include penalties for simply breaking the law, which can be justified through mental contortions great and small.

Code of Honor
The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.</description>

					<quality name="Did You Just Call Me Dumb?">
						<description>The character can't resist camouflaging insults into well-spoken words. The character gets the satisfaction of feeling superior to everyone. Unfortunately, once in a while people will notice and get pretty upset. Any Glitch rolled by this character on any Social test always counts as a Critical Glitch.</description>

					<quality name="Social Stress: Dealing with AIs" useradded="no">
						<description>Whether as a result of loss or trauma or due to innate psychological makeup, the Social Stress quality burdens the character with emotions that interfere with his ability to interact with others. A specific cause and trigger for the Social Stress must be established. For example, if his Social Stress is caused by survivor's guilt after the loss of a close friend, unexpectedly encountering someone who looks similar to the lost friend will heighten stress. When a character is using Leadership or Etiquette skills, reduce the number of 1s required to glitch the test by 1. Gamemasters should call for more Social Tests for characters with Social Stress to determine how a character reacts to others, particularly if a situation related to the cause of their stress arises.</description>

					<quality name="Wanted">
						<description>It feels so good to be wanted, or maybe not. Though most runners are probably wanted for questioning in a few cases, this is something different. When the character takes this quality, they work out why they have a bounty or contract on their head. The bounty should be worth at least 25,000 nuyen, enough to tempt even one's own "friends." The character should have to frequently deal with someone coming for them or finding out about the bounty and using it against them.

If for some reason the bounty ever goes away, like the character is turned in or they clear their name, the quality must be bought off with Karma.</description>

Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case.

Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle.

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="5.09" base="5" modified="5.09" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="9.09" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<quality name="SINner (Corporate SIN): Spinrad Global">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

Corporate SIN At the 25 Karma level is the Corporate Born SIN. The character with this ID was probably born into a mega corporation, or belonged to one when it achieved extraterritoriality. At least one of his parents probably had the Corporate Born SIN as well. He grew up in the corporation, his social involvement, education, and almost every aspect of his life was managed by the corporation. His skills and aptitudes were evaluated constantly, and he was groomed for the career path to which he was best suited; his whole world was the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Born SIN had the potential and the opportunity to advance through the corporation hierarchy. He could have been a department administrator, a finance strategist, an agent of corporate intelligence, an officer in a megacorp's military, or even a member of Corporate Special Forces (Renraku's Red Samurai or Ares' Firewatch). With a Corporate Born SIN, he could have enjoyed top-secret clearance within the corporation and access to nearly unlimited resources. Then something happened. An unforgivably costly mistake, the machinations of a rival, a supervisor in need of a scapegoat - something pushed the character out of the corporation and into the cold and unforgiving shadows. In the shadows a SIN that had been the key to opportunity is now a deadly liability. Most in the shadows see the Corporate Born as the privileged few, the aristocrats in the armored limousines who look down on them, oppress them, exploit them and deny them their basic rights. If the SINless discover the character's Corporate Born SIN, reactions will range from deep suspicion to violent hostility; serious injury and death are real possibilities. The character's loyalty to his corporation is never questioned, which can be an insurmountable liability in a culture that works against the megacorps. Would-be runners have been killed for holding Corporate Born SINs. Fortunately, Corporate Born records are limited to the megacorporation that generated them. Files in the Global SIN Registry can confirm she has a valid SIN, but do not contain any additional information. Those with Corporate Born SINs pay a tax of ten percent of their gross income to their corporation</description>

This is the commlink you buy when you have absolutely no concern for money and you desperately want to keep on the cutting edge of fashion. These commlinks are extraordinarily exclusive, and just having one is enough to convince the jet-set crowd that you are one of them. Good luck acquiring one, though. Spinrad Industries has a waiting list longer than Johnny Spinradâs ego, so if you arenât royalty or the CEO of a megacorp, you might be out of luck.

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they're used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.</description>

					<item name="Stealth Tags" quantity="10">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Stealth Tags: A stealth tag always runs silent (p. 235) and has a Sleaze rating equal to its Device Rating. It's disguised to not look like RFID tags, which gives it an additional -2 Concealability modifier. Stealth tags are often used as a backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.</description>

						<description>The next best thing to telepathy is the ability to stage-whisper at any range. Attached with adhesive to your throat, this hard-to-spot microphone lets you communicate via subvocalized speech. A -4 dice pool modifier is applied to Perception Tests to overhear you when you're subvocalizing.</description>

					<item name="Theatrical Cosmetics Kit" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This kit provides various types of makeup, hair dye, temporary facial prosthetics, and other equipment required for creating a disguise or physically impersonating a specific individual. Each kit has enough materials for ten disguises, after which a new kit must be purchased. Unlike a regular Disguise Kit (p. 136, SR5), a theatrical disguise kit does not require an Extended Test, but it also does not provide the extra dice pool bonus such a kit might provide. Instead, it takes a flat duration of ten minutes to apply.</description>

					<item name="Ultrasonic Noise Generator" rating="1" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>A variation of the standard white noise generator, this model is tuned to ultrasonic frequencies. While inaudible to unaugmented metahumans, it is sufficient to blind ultrasound sensors. Each point of Rating adds one die to the user's Sneaking + Agility test to avoid detection via ultrasound systems.</description>
