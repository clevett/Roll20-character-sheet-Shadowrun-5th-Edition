				<attribute name="Body" text="3/5" base="3" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="5"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5/6" base="5" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

				<attribute name="Magic" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Heritage???Special">
					<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

					<quality name="Adept">
						<description>â¢ Adepts channel mana into their own bodies to enhance their natural abilities, making their talents and skills much more potent.

â¢ Adepts never astrally project (p. 313).

â¢ Adepts only perceive astral space by purchasing the Astral Perception power (p. 312).

â¢ Adepts can learn the Assensing skill only if they have the Astral Perception power.

â¢ Adepts cannot use skills from any magic-related skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting).

â¢ Adepts can follow mentor spirits (p. 320).

â¢ Adepts gain Adept Powers that are purchased with Power Points. Adepts receive a number of Power Points equal to their Magic rating.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Ambidexterous">
						<description>The Ambidextrous character can handle objects equally well with either hand. Without this quality, any action performed solely with the off - hand (i.e., firing a gun) suffers a -2 dice pool modifier (see Attacker Using Off-Hand Weapon, p. 178).</description>
						<traitcost bp="4"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Sharpshooter">
						<description>Through focus and vigilance it's possible to hone a shooting skill to the point of an excess of precision. This honing means that specific techniques are trained to the point of perfection, but in that training, other, more basic maneuvers are skipped over. Characters with this quality are more skilled at making Called Shots, but at the cost of their basic shooting skills. Penalties for Called Shots are decreased by 2, while all other Ranged Attack actions suffer a -1 dice pool penalty.</description>
						<traitcost bp="4"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Strive For Perfection">
						<description>Excellence in his craft is what this assassin aims for. It is not enough to take out the target; the job must be done efficiently, quickly, and without the slightest misstep. This is what separates the good assassins from the great ones in his mind, and he aims to be one of the greats.

Advantages: The assassin has honed his skills with firearms to the point where shots that would be tough for most people are second nature to him. Halve the cost of all Called Shots, meaning they impose only a -2 dice pool penalty instead of -4. The Called Shot still costs a Free Action.

Disadvantages: The standard "aiming for center mass" shots that most people take are beneath this sort of assassin. He seeks to make every shot count, regardless of how many bullets are in his magazine. The assassin must make Called Shots unless he is providing covering fire or acting in a similar capacity where Called Shots would not be practical.</description>
						<traitcost bp="12"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Will to Live (1)" rank="1">
						<description>For each rating point in Will to Live, the character gains 1 additional Damage Overflow Box (p. 101). These additional boxes only allow the character to sustain additional damage before dying; they do not raise the threshold at which the character becomes unconscious or incapacitated, nor do they affect modifiers from the damage the character has taken.</description>

				<negative>
					<quality name="Code of Honor: Nationalist/Japan (7dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.

The Code of Honor can take other forms as well. For example:
â¢ Assassin's Creed: A character never kills anyone that they are not paid to kill. Being precise as an assassin, not leaving collateral damage, and being invisible are important hallmarks of those who believe in the Assassin's Creed. Characters who take this version of Code of Honor lose 1 point of Karma for every unintentional and/or unpaid murder they commit, and their Public Awareness goes up by 1 for each such death.
â¢ Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.</description>

					<quality name="Creature of Comfort (Middle Lifestyle)" rank="1">
						<description>For the character with this quality, the rewards of a job well done are the finer things in life. Unfortunately, one can quickly get attached to the comforts one has acquired, making the fall seem ever so higher. At the 10 Karma level, the character is used to a Middle Lifestyle, at the 17 level a High, and 25, it's Luxury all the way, baby.

For every day that the character must spend "slumming" it in a lower Lifestyle category, the irritable character suffers a -1 penalty to all Social and Healing tests per Lifestyle category below his chosen level. For example, if the character takes this Quality at the High Lifestyle level and is forced to stay in a Squatter Lifestyle, he will suffer -3 to all Social and Healing tests. Life just isn't worth living without Cognac.</description>

						<description>An adept with Eidetic Sense Memory is capable of memorizing all sensory input, including tastes, smells and textures in addition to the more traditional visual ability. The adept is capable of perfectly recalling any sensory stimulus, or combination thereof. The memories can be recalled at will. The adept also has the ability to photo-read, making it a great trick for those Awakened who like book clubs.</description>

This power cannot be used with Unarmed Combat, but it can be purchased multiple times with a different skill each time.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Freefall (4)" name="Freefall" rating="4">
						<description>This power helps adepts absorb the damage from a fall or jump down for a specific distance. This ability does not help the adept increase the distance he is jumping, such as with the Light Body power. Every level of Freefall allows the adept to fall or jump down 3 additional meters without any adverse effects (beyond the three meters normally allowed). When calculating fall damage past his personal distance threshold, subtract the overall level bonus from the Damage Value of the fall and then apply damage normally (see p. 172, SR5). This means that an adept with Freefall receives no damage from a fall of six meters or less, rather than the typical three meters. Beyond that, if an adept with two levels of Freefall falls 15 meters, the power negates 6 points of damage from the fall, changing the Damage Value of the fall from 15P to 9P (the fall's AP remains unchanged). As long as the adept experiences no damage from the fall (either because the fall was short enough to cause no damage or because they successfully resisted all applicable damage using Body + Armor, the fall counts as a normal move action, and can be combined with an attack. Any other means of dealing with the damage does not allow this opportunity. Longer falls count as a Complex Action.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Hang Time (1)" name="Hang Time" rating="1">
						<description>Adepts with this power receive two benefits. First, for each level of this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for all Climbing Tests. Second, the adept can temporarily adhere to surfaces, such as walls. For each level of this power, the adept can attach himself to a surface and hang out for approximately five minutes, provided he remains motionless and keeps physical contact with the surface in question with hands, feet, knees, or elbows. The adept must spend a Simple Action to bond his magical energy with the surface; normal clothing such as gloves or boots does not interfere with this power, but the use of heavy armor (armor with a Rating of 13 or higher) will. Moving the attached body parts on the surface they're adhering to, such as a moving vehicle, breaks the bond, making the adept fall off.</description>

					<item name="Ares Striker" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>One of the most rugged and certainly the heaviest (in terms of weight) pistols on the market, the Striker is simplicity personified. Designed for ease of use, the Striker lacks any of the electronics that modern pistols employ, making it immune to hacking and malware. With its striker fire design and backstrap safety, there are no external hammers or levers, making for a sleek design that wonât snag on your clothes when itâs needed. The comparatively low cost of the Striker makes it an ideal choice for people who arenât yet ready to make the financial commitment that higher-end models requireâit was this yearâs most popular quinceaÃ±era gift in its category.

Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

						<description>Not to be confused with good olâ Stick-n-Shock, these rounds actually cause damage to electronic systems, rather than the electronics themselves. Using a mix of wireless data burst broadcasting tech and dense IC coding, the round attacks the object in the âMatrix.â Why the quotes? Glad you asked, because early models were useless once you shut the wireless off on your device. But thatâs not the case after the redesign. Now, as long as your device is active and capable of accessing the Matrix, even if the receiver is currently shut down, the contact protocols in the rounds do the job as long as youâre a good shot.

Hereâs what I mean. Use these on someone actively connected, hidden or not, and you can pretty much hit anywhere on their person and something is gonna get popped. The coding latches onto the first device it can break through and then folds and repeats inside, using its limited power to pull off its effect. Mass effect versions that scramble and frag up everything are in the works, but for now youâll only find that bit of gear terrorism over in the grenades department.

Now, if youâre a solid shot, you can bullseye something specific and you can pretty much guarantee the codeâs concentrated enough to drill into that single piece. More than one decker has been unprepared for one of these hitting their deck. Most decks have better protection than your average armored jacket and they might be able to take the hit, but get tagged while you were planning to sleaze in rather than take on IC and you just might be taking pointers from the street sam about how to stay useful in the fight. Of course, he might be slowed down to your speed, because his wires got tagged too.

Zapper Round Rules
Rather than doing normal damage, these bullets do Matrix Damage. The standard ranged attack roll is made with damage increased by net hits and applied to a single device possessed, worn, carried, or implanted in the targeted individual. The device receiving the damage is selected at random by the gamemaster, or by the attacking player if they succeed in a Called Shot. Devices can only be targeted by a Called Shot if they are visible to the attacker. Damage Resistance roll is made using the Device Rating + Firewall, along with any other damage resistance programs.

Burst Fire and Full Auto have an alternate option. Instead of hindering the targetâs Defense Test, the attack strikes multiple devices, or one device more than once. Burst Fire hits twice, Long Burst hits three times, and Full Auto hits four times.</description>

						<description>Can't resist throwing on the little tag line just so we remember who's in charge of this line. A few years back these lines were hot, but they've been adding feature after feature since then so that the things are getting pretty unwieldy. The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.

I'll admit I loved Manhunt, that remake of the old flatvid with the alien hunting a bunch of mercenaries in the jungle. This stuff makes me think of that trid every time I activate our display. It's high-tech camouflage at its finest. Add this to your favorite outfit and be ready to blend in anywhere.</description>

This modification can be added to any armor or clothing, but it only gains its full benefits when applied to pieces that cover the wearer's whole body, like full body armors or cloaks. The ruthenium polymers are controlled by a sensor suite incorporated into the armor or clothing that scans the surroundings and replicates images of the area at the proper perspectives, helping the wearer blend in. The effectiveness is based on the Rating of the sensor suite and the extent of the suit's coverage. The base modifier to a Perception Test to spot the wearer is - (Rating), adjusted by the extent of the suit; full +0, almost full +1, half +2.</description>

						<description>Can't resist throwing on the little tag line just so we remember who's in charge of this line. A few years back these lines were hot, but they've been adding feature after feature since then so that the things are getting pretty unwieldy. The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.</description>

								<description>Items that are Custom Fit were measured for a specific person. They are specially designed for that person and don't fit well on anyone else, therefore conferring none of the positive Social Limit adjustments to the character. When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

The character has to select a specific set of Armored Clothing to have the piece Custom Fit with. The Custom Fit combination then allows the character to use either the base armor or add on the stack bonus for that set of gear.</description>

					<item name="Safe Target System" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>The goal of this system is to avoid those situations where your mates are chewing you out for accidentally shooting them in the hoop. Using information about your teammates' appearance and the electronics in their PAN, this system attempts to recognize when you are aiming at any spot within 1 meter of a friendly target. In these situations, the system locks the trigger, preventing you from firing. Once the friendly target isn't at risk anymore, you can start firing again. Note that the system interprets risk broadly - if there is something between you and a friendly target, the system will lock you out, unless that "something" is an entire office building or Mt. Rushmore or something.

The basic system can mark up to 10 RFID profiles (or GPS coordinates if you want to designate fixed locations as "safe"); for a few extra nuyen you can add more profiles. If you want a little more accuracy, allowing you to easily shoot the drekhead who stole your buddy's commlink without difficulty, then upgrade to the image recognition system. You'll need a guncam or smartlink to use this function. The base image recognition allows you to enter up to 10 different visual profiles, which can be as broad as "anyone wearing the Ancients' logo" or as narrow as precise scans of members of your team. As with the GPS/RFID system, you can spring for extra profiles if you need them.

The safe target system can be mounted on any location besides the stock.</description>

					<item name="Shop, Automotive Mechanic" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>Building and repairing items requires the right tools for the job. Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Armorer shop, a Disguise kit, a Nautical Mechanic facility, etc.).  A shop is transportable in the back of a van and contains more advanced tools for building and repairing. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

						<description>With the popular nanopaste disguise kit falling in popularity due to CFD concerns, the synthskin facemask has taken its market share. It is composed of a programmable electropolymer commonly used in the skin covering of synthetic cyberware and humanoid mimic drones. It produces a lifelike replica of an individual's face. A person's face can be duplicated if you have a scan from a biometric reader (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the biometric reader's Rating). A Software + Logic Test (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the successes) can replicate a specific individual's face or create a completely unique appearance. In either case, the limit on the test is equal to the Rating of the mask. The mask is reusable in the sense that it can be worn multiple times, but once an appearance has been set in either fashion described above, it cannot be altered.</description>
