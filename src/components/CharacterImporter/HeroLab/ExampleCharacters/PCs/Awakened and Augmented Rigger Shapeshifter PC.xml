				<attribute name="Body" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="5" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="0"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="5"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="5" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="0"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

				<attribute name="Magic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="0" category="Heritage???Special">
					<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

					<quality name="Gearhead">
						<description>The Gearhead is who you look for when it's time to stomp on the gas and move. She's a natural-born driver or pilot. When she's at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she's controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed or the Handling of her vehicle or drone by +1 (player’s choice) for 1D6 minutes. She also receives a +2 dice pool modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes. The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Hawk Eye" useradded="no">
						<description>Characters with the Hawk Eye quality have exceptionally keen natural vision. They can identify a face a block away without binoculars or spot a spent casing in a shadowy crack at five meters. Characters gain a +1 dice pool modifier to their Perception Tests and shift all Range Environmental modifiers up one category (e.g., Medium becomes Short). The quality is part of characters' natural eyes and is not compatible with electronic vision enhancements and/or cyber- or bioware augmentations or replacements.</description>
						<traitcost bp="0"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Mentor Spirit: Raven (Alt)">
						<description>Everyone needs some help in life, even if it comes from someone relatively filmy and insubstantial. Mentor Spirit means the character follows a patron spirit (see Mentor Spirits, p. 320) that guides him in his practice of magic and provides certain advantages and disadvantages to his natural abilities. A character may change mentor spirits, but he may have only one mentor spirit at a time. To change mentor spirits, the character must first buy off the current mentor spirit as if it were a Negative quality. He can then purchase the quality again to follow a different mentor spirit. This cost represents the toll of divorcing from one mentor spirit and bonding with a new one.

Each tradition has a different name for a mentor spirit. Hermetic mages prefer the term "mentor spirit," while shamans use the word "totem" for the spirit that they follow. While the names may vary, the way the mentor works is consistent.

This quality is only available to characters that possess a Magic attribute rating.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Restricted Gear: Control Rig (Deltaware)">
						<description>Right place, right time, right friend, or the stars aligned. No matter the reason, the character has managed to acquire or get a line on one piece of really hard-to-find gear she absolutely had to have. The character can take this quality up to three times; only one of those times can occur at character creation. Selecting it at character creation allows the character to buy a piece of gear with an Availability of up to 24 (circumventing the normal Availability limit at character creation). After character creation, taking this quality lets the character purchase one piece of gear with an Availability up to 18 during play with just a single commcall. They do, however, have to pay an extra thirty percent for the item.</description>

					<quality name="Sioux Aspected Magician (Conjuring)">
						<description>• Aspected magicians are a limited form of magician.

• Aspected magicians do not astrally project.

• Aspected magicians can astrally perceive.

• Aspected magicians must choose one, and only one, of the following three Skills/Skill Groups.

• Sorcery (Spellcasting and related skills) • Conjuring (Summoning and related skills) • Enchanting (Alchemy and related skills) • Aspected magicians cannot perform any of the magical skills associated with the two groups they did not select.

• Aspected magicians can only learn Counterspelling if they take the skills to be a spellcaster.

• Aspected magicians can follow mentor spirits.

• At character creation, aspected magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).</description>

					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Hawk" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Compulsive (Specific Public) (2): Kleptomania" rank="2">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Compulsive (4 To 12 Karma): There is an order to all things that must be maintained, and the character feels the need to exert their sense of order on everything. The value of this mental malady comes from how severe the compulsion is and how much of a negative impact it can have on the character. Maybe she likes a tidy house, maybe she sees a necessary order to the items on the tables out in the world, or maybe she feels the need to practice her skills (be they hacking, casting, shooting, talking, stealing, sneaking, etc.) every chance she gets. The character must make a Composure (2) test to resist the compulsion. The base Karma value is (2 x threshold needed for Composure Test; must be from 1 to 4); then add 2 for things in the character's personal environment (e.g., placement of furniture and minor appliances), 3 for a single aspect of the public environment (e.g., correcting bad apostrophes on signs, counting every Ford Americar they see), or 4 for a broad aspect of the public environment (e.g., touching every light post they walk by, hacking into every camera they see).</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Spirit Bane: Spirits of Earth">
						<description>A character with a Spirit Bane really torques off a certain type of spirit (p. 303). Whether the character has a reputation for harming this sort of spirit or something about her aura enrages them, spirits of the type affected by the Spirit Bane are likely to harass the character when she is in their presence, and they may be reluctant to obey or perform favors for the character or her friends. If spirits of this type are ordered to attack a party that includes the character, these spirits will single her out and attempt to destroy her first. Affected spirits will always use lethal force against these characters with the Spirit Bane quality. If the character with Spirit Bane tries to summon or bind this spirit, she suffers a -2 dice pool modifier for the attempt. If the summoner tries to banish a spirit of this type, the spirit receives a +2 dice pool modifier for resisting her attempt. Watchers and minions do not count for Spirit Bane, as they are constructs that are not summoned like normal spirits.

This quality may only be taken by magic users. Magic users may possess this quality for a type of spirit that is not a part of their magical tradition.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

							<description>This implant harnesses the raw data-coordinating and synchronization power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it's like getting a free datajack). When you're jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Speed of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), again when you're jumped in.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

Even when you aren’t wearing the right outfit for a situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes) with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).</description>

						<description>Clothing in 2075 comes with amazing features you'll likely completely take for granted. Commlinks, music players, and other electronic devices can be woven right into the fabric, powered by interwoven batteries or special energy-gathering fabrics. On the other side of the economy, cheap soy-based "flats" can be had for five nuyen per article of clothing from vending machines around the Sprawl. The more money you spend on your threads, the more impressive you look.</description>

								<description>This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social camouflage. Even when you aren’t wearing the right outfit for a situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes) with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).</description>

						<description>Concealed as mundane items like buttons, earrings, necklaces, pins, and other baubles and bobs, these devices function as Sensor Tags (p. 440, SR5). These items have a Concealability modifier of –6 in respect to determining their true nature.

Sensor Tags
These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Sensor Tags: A sensor RFID tag can be equipped with a single sensor (sold separately) of up to Rating 2 (Sensors, p. 445). It then records everything it can, to a maximum of 24 hours of time, at which point you can program it to either shut off or overwrite data older than 24 hours. Sensor tags are often used for diagnostic purposes in various devices, including cyberware.</description>

You can put sensors in just about everything, and lots of people do. Your can of FizzyGoo is watching you and reporting back to marketing. You can play the sensor game, too.

Sensors need to be placed in a housing or case of some sort, or built into another device. Sensors can record data themselves or forward it wirelessly in real-time or as files to other devices. Sensors are available in seven ratings (2-8) and two types: single and array. When you use the sensor array for Perception Tests, you may use your Electronic Warfare skill in place of your Perception skill, and you may use the sensor's Rating as your limit.

Single sensor: This is a sensor that can do only one function listed under Sensor Functions.</description>

						<description>Building and repairing items requires the right tools for the job. Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Armorer shop, a Disguise kit, a Nautical Mechanic facility, etc.).  A shop is transportable in the back of a van and contains more advanced tools for building and repairing. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

						<description>What do you do with a lot of relatively stupid drones? Create one reasonably smart swarm! A drone (or vehicle) swarm is a network of linked drones all slaved (p. 233, SR5) to a single RCC running the Swarm program. You can include as many drones in a swarm as your RCC can slave (Device Rating x 3), or split them up among several swarms (again, limited by your RCC's slave limit). To start a swarm, simply run the Swarm program on your RCC, slave your drones, and command them to join the swarm you designate for them.

Each swarm acts as a single drone with multiple, separate "bodies." Its Pilot rating is equal to the highest Pilot rating of its member drones, or the Device Rating of the RCC, whichever is higher. The swarm uses the highest- rated of each autosoft running on any drone or the RCC, and the highest Sensor rating. It uses the lowest of the drones' Handling, Speed, and Acceleration ratings. When performing actions, the swarm gets a dice pool and limit bonus equal to one less than the number of drones in the swarm.

In combat, all drones attack with whatever weapons they have, but for game purposes only use a single weapon's stats (the others are covered by the action bonuses the swarm receives), although roll scatter for explosive weapons separately. Drones in a swarm must be targeted individually by attackers - the loss of drones from a swarm due to damage, hacking, or other mishaps affects the swarm's bonuses and ratings immediately.

Note: The effects of this program have not been implemented yet.</description>

					<item name="Tag Eraser" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.</description>

						<description>A rigger command console, or RCC, is like a deck for controlling drones (or other vehicles and devices). It's about the size of a briefcase. It can act like a commlink and has all the features of a commlink in addition to the cool drone stuff. The main purpose of the RCC is to create a PAN with your drones. This gives the standard master-slave benefits (see PANs and WANs, p. 233), but the RCC comes with some extra features.</description>

Another persona can see what the disguised icon really is with a Matrix Perception Test, but they need to at least suspect enough to check (Matrix Perception, p. 241).</description>
