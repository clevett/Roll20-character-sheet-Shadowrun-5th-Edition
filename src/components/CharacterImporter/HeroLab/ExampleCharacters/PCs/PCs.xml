				<attribute name="Body" text="9" base="9" modified="9" naturalmaximum="11" augmentedmaximum="13" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="5/7" base="5" modified="7" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5/7" base="5" modified="7" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="8/10" base="8" modified="10" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="0.51" base="1" modified="0.51" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="4.51" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Biocompatibility (Cyberware)">
						<description>Something about the character's body is exceptionally accepting of either bioware or cyberware implants (choose one). Not only are the implants not rejected, but they seamlessly fit within the body, having less impact on its holistic integrity. In game terms, the Essence cost of implants of the particular chosen type are reduced by ten percent, rounded down to the tenth. This rebate is cumulative with the reduction offered by the chosen 'ware's grade, if any (e.g., the reduction for alphaware of 0.8 is reduced by ten percent, or 0.08, to become 0.72, and is rounded down to 0.7). This quality can only be chosen for bioware or cyberware. This quality may only be taken once.</description>
						<traitcost bp="5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Common Sense">
						<description>"Common sense is not so common" as they say. It's nothing supernatural, just a keen sense of knowing when something is just a bad idea. Any time a character with this quality is about to do something the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must act as their proverbial inner voice of reason and issue a little warning. The gamemaster can only give a number of warnings per session equal to or less than the character's Edge rating. After that, they're on their own.</description>
						<traitcost bp="3"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Goring Horns" useradded="no">
						<description>A single horn or horns express on the character's head. If the character already had horns, these grow even bigger or more pronounced. The horns can be anything from ram horns to deer-like antlers to devil horns or even jagged crests of bone around the skull. Unlike most metatype horns, the character may use these in combat with the Exotic Melee Weapon (Horns) skill. Goring Horns have the following stats: DV (STR + 2)P, Reach - , AP -1.</description>

				</positive>
				<negative>
					<quality name="No Man Left Behind">
						<description>You can’t leave a fallen comrade behind to be taken by the enemy. Whether they are dead or just knocked out, you won’t leave them to the wolves. Any time a team member falls (even one you don’t particularly like), make a Composure (4) Test. Success means you’ve overcome this urge to save your fallen comrade (though you can still do so if you choose); failure means you need to do everything within your power, up to and including self-sacrifice, to get your companion out of the hot zone and to safety.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-7"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Uneducated">
						<description>An Uneducated character is not mentally impaired - she just never had the opportunity to learn. Whether because she and her family were isolated squatters, or were SINless, or otherwise underprivileged, she was denied access to the education system. She has only a rudimentary knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered "unaware" in Technical, Academic Knowledge, and Professional Knowledge skills they do not possess (see Skill Ratings, p. 129), and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical sprawl-dweller takes for granted. Additionally, the Karma cost for learning new skills, skill groups or specializations (or for improving existing ones) in these categories is doubled compared to the normal cost (including at character creation), and it’s possible the character will never learn some skill groups belonging to these categories.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					<item name="Bow (Compound)" rating="10" quantity="1" size="Troll Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action (Ready Weapon, p. 165).

Bows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffers a -3 dice pool modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. The weapon's Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow's rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

A compound bow cannot use the Overdraw action due to the nature of the pulley system it uses. The benefit of a compound bow is that the pulley system makes it extremely easy to hold the bow drawn, allowing an archer to maintain a Take Aim action for (Body x 4) Combat Turns. A compound bow can also mount a smartlink, as the pulley system gives the projectiles a fixed velocity.

With any bow or crossbow, a laser sight is ineffective at any range beyond Short due to parabolic nature of the projectiles. Unless you somehow get a laser that also travels in a parabola. Which you can't.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

								<description>Have trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn't have one. But if that's not an option, then try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives your grip a bunch of tiny fibers that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibers can be turned on and off via wireless command if you have a smartgun - if not, pressing two buttons at the same time does the trick. The mod gives a +6 bonus on any tests to see if a character keeps grip on the gun. This can go on any weapon with a grip, whether they have a stock slot or not; if they have a stock slot, this takes it up.</description>

						<description>The Onotari JP-K50 has an unusual past, being originally conceived for the next round of the Euro Wars, which never came about. Or at least, haven't yet. It was shelved for decades, and only recently came back into the production queue during the so-called Dragon Civil War. Able to switch between long-range fire against a single hard armored target (such as a dragon) or firing bursts against clusters (such as drakes), it was seen as a weapon that could be issued to entire squads. Not mass produced, but produced enough that cost trumped quality in many ways, the final result is a sort of super-sized assault rifle rather than the kind of high-quality precision design that Saeder-Krupp is world famous for.</description>

								<description>This stuff looks silly but can save your life. Gel packs look like a bunch of take-out soy sauce packets layered all over your clothes or armor. They come in a variety of colors and can even be custom ordered with different colors in each packet to make a pattern or just add a little flare. The gel hardens for an instant to absorb some of the force of impact but then gets all squishy again if it isn't punctured. If the gel makes contact with air it turns dusty and brittle immediately.

Installed externally, gel packs require no Capacity and increase the Armor Rating of whatever they are added to by 2. Since gel packs solidify for a brief instant, they increase the possibility that the wearer will be knocked down by an attack. When comparing the Physical Limit of a character using armor with gel packs to the DV of an attack to determine knockdown (see Knockdown, p. 194, SR5), lower the character's Physical Limit by 2.</description>

						<description>Max Value: 1,000,000¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

						<description>Sensors are found almost everywhere. Cheaply produced by the billions, miniaturization and integration have made sensors both located everywhere and hard to spot. You can put sensors in just about everything, and lots of people do. Your can of FizzyGoo is watching you and reporting back to marketing. You can play the sensor game, too.

Sensors need to be placed in a housing or case of some sort, or built into another device. Sensors can record data themselves or forward it wirelessly in real-time or as files to other devices. Sensors are available in seven ratings (2-8) and two types: single and array. When you use the sensor array for Perception Tests, you may use your Electronic Warfare skill in place of your Perception skill, and you may use the sensor's Rating as your limit. Sensors can be put into devices that have capacity.

Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats). What you can put your sensor in is limited by the Rating of the sensor (see Sensor Housings table).</description>

Olfactory Booster
This cybersnout enhances, identifies and records smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you - you'll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scenthound would. You can smell people's emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker's mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds - the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. The olfactory booster can even be used in VR to create an even more immersive experience. Add the booster's rating as a dice pool modifier to your scent-based Perception Tests.</description>

					<item name="Hard Corps Security Uniform XXXXXL" quantity="1" size="Troll Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>One of the biggest troubles runners have is with the uniforms they are required to wear for their disguise and cover story. The details about the uniforms should be exactly right to avoid tipping people off. There are fixers out there that specialize in acquiring uniforms for such jobs (usually fenced to them by runners following successful runs when they picked this stuff up) and selling them to runners. Your fixer may be one of them, or if not, he likely knows someone else who deals in these disguises. Get to know one of these fixers because they can do a lot for you. A truly talented disguise fixer will know precisely what gear you will need to sell the disguise (everything from the actual medical bags and kits that DocWagon medics use and carry around with them to the proper, authorized body armor and restraints used by Lone Star officers). They will know which uniforms wear chevrons and how many years of service each chevron depicts. They will understand the rank system that many medical and law enforcement professionals use, and can tell you how many chevrons your uniform needs if you are trying to pull off the look of a Knight Errant Lieutenant (at least three chevrons, BTW). They will be able to tell you how decorations are meant to be worn, and more importantly, in which order. For those that don’t know, Knight Errant officers wear their decorations over their badges when they are in their uniforms, but not when they are in their full body armor.

These fixers can also provide authentic badges for you to wear on these uniforms. Many law enforcement agencies and corporations still rely on metal badges as a time-honored tradition, though properly encrypted AROs are more common. Either element—the badge or the ID ARO—cannot be simply duplicated by a fashion spell. Most people won’t bother copying the badge number. They have been conditioned by the megacorporations over the years to blindly accept authority in all forms. So even if the badge was taken off a cop that had been killed in the line of duty, it should be sufficient to give you the time to get the job done (provided you don’t pass an observant cop in the hallway leading to your destination who happens to recognize the number).

Knowing the dress codes for each organization is another essential, which any good fixer who specializes in these disguises will know. Knight Errant, for example, has started a new policy of requiring its beat cops to have cyberware with the synthetic coverings installed. So, if you’re pretending to be a Knight Errant cop and you have chrome showing, that could be a big tipoff that you aren’t who you say you are. Lone Star requires its cops to cover up all tattoos and body modifications. This is the information the right fixer can give you.</description>

					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				<attribute name="Intuition" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">

				<attribute name="Charisma" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="1.23" base="1" modified="1.23" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="5.23" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Friends in High Places">
						<description>"So sorry, Damian, I can't head out on the new Ares prototype ship with you this weekend, I have a run," is something a character with this quality might actually say. This quality gives the character an additional pool of Free Karma for purchasing contacts, with a few stipulations. First, the character gets an additional Charisma x 4 in Karma to purchase contacts. Second, none of these contacts can have a Connection Rating less than 8. Third, any leftover Karma that the character cannot spend is lost. These contacts can't be called at every turn; see the Who You Know chapter for information on what happens if the favors of contacts are abused. (p. 172).</description>

					<quality name="Jack of All Trades, Master of None">
						<description>The character has an incredible aptitude for learning new skills. Unfortunately, the character quickly gets bored and gets turned off when things start getting a little hard. Karma costs are reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for learning skills up to Rating 5. Beyond Rating 5, however, it costs 2 additional points of Karma for each point of skill. This quality does not apply during character creation.</description>

					<quality name="Privileged Family Name">
						<description>With this quality the character's family is exceptionally well-connected, and his real name carries significant clout in his home sprawl (selected at character creation). Though probably known as a rich, spoiled brat, the name (and accompanying SIN and ID) is like a get-out-of-jailfree card for small misdemeanors (such as being caught carrying a weapon, casting an unauthorized mental manipulation spell, or driving a car without a license). Even when trying to act tough, local minor NPCs suffer a -2 dice pool modifier on Social tests against the character. In order to have this quality the character must also possess the SINner (National or Corporate) quality. Remember that this quality also makes the character very easy to identify if those not concerned with their family name start asking questions.</description>

					<quality name="Trust Fund (High &amp; 1,000¥/month)" rank="3">
						<description>Everyone knows you're in the shadows for the rush or to fulfill some kind of Batman wannabe fantasy. Every month your trust fund spills out enough to live off, but just living is boring. A character with this quality possesses a lifelong trust fund or inheritance that is managed by another party (a trustee). The quality has four versions depending on just how rich and shady a runner is willing to be. For 5 Karma, the trust fund income covers a Middle lifestyle with 500 nuyen left over each month. For 10 Karma, the income covers a Low Lifestyle but offers the character 2,000 + (3D6 x 100) nuyen each month thanks to a deal with their landlord to rip off the trustee. For 15 Karma, the income covers a High Lifestyle with 1,000 nuyen left over. For 20 Karma, the money covers a Middle Lifestyle and offers 3,000 + (6d6 x 100) nuyen thanks to one of those special deals. The character must also possess the SINner (National or Corporate) quality; additionally, the lifestyle they pay for cannot be paid for through other sources and is part of the records connected to the SIN. None of these lifestyles can be shared on a long-term basis, as the landlords are leery of anyone staying at the place and possibly ruining their deal. Note that there is a chance that if the character is caught breaking the law, the trustee may suspend benefits at the gamemaster's discretion.</description>

					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Mild, Necrophobia" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					<quality name="SINner (Corporate SIN): Shiawase">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

Corporate SIN At the 25 Karma level is the Corporate Born SIN. The character with this ID was probably born into a mega corporation, or belonged to one when it achieved extraterritoriality. At least one of his parents probably had the Corporate Born SIN as well. He grew up in the corporation, his social involvement, education, and almost every aspect of his life was managed by the corporation. His skills and aptitudes were evaluated constantly, and he was groomed for the career path to which he was best suited; his whole world was the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Born SIN had the potential and the opportunity to advance through the corporation hierarchy. He could have been a department administrator, a finance strategist, an agent of corporate intelligence, an officer in a megacorp's military, or even a member of Corporate Special Forces (Renraku's Red Samurai or Ares' Firewatch). With a Corporate Born SIN, he could have enjoyed top-secret clearance within the corporation and access to nearly unlimited resources. Then something happened. An unforgivably costly mistake, the machinations of a rival, a supervisor in need of a scapegoat - something pushed the character out of the corporation and into the cold and unforgiving shadows. In the shadows a SIN that had been the key to opportunity is now a deadly liability. Most in the shadows see the Corporate Born as the privileged few, the aristocrats in the armored limousines who look down on them, oppress them, exploit them and deny them their basic rights. If the SINless discover the character's Corporate Born SIN, reactions will range from deep suspicion to violent hostility; serious injury and death are real possibilities. The character's loyalty to his corporation is never questioned, which can be an insurmountable liability in a culture that works against the megacorps. Would-be runners have been killed for holding Corporate Born SINs. Fortunately, Corporate Born records are limited to the megacorporation that generated them. Files in the Global SIN Registry can confirm she has a valid SIN, but do not contain any additional information. Those with Corporate Born SINs pay a tax of ten percent of their gross income to their corporation</description>

							<description>An advanced form of the old invoked memory stimulator cyberware, this system features a micro-memory module, a processor, and a dedicated nanohive supporting a specialized neural amplifier colony. Flashback nanites organize themselves into a network of sensors and nanofilaments - similar in many respects to a trode net - over the surface of the user's brain. These probe nanites register neural activity associated with memory formation, backing up the patterns to digital memory. If the subject suffers a brain injury or even simple forgetfulness, the system can access these neural records and stimulate the same neural activity, prompting recall.

You receive the Photographic Memory quality (p. 76, SR5) regarding any experience within the flashback system's storage. These memories are so vivid that it's like viewing a simsense recording of the experience. The system does not store actual memories, just the neural activity map, so the data is useless without your personal brain, and memories may be affected by drugs that inhibit or cause loss of memory.

Photographic Memory
A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard.

Simrig
This simsense recorder can record experience data (sensory and emotive) from you or whoever is wearing it. Simrig rigs are used to make most of the simsense chips sold on the market. You'll need to have a working sim module (with the DNI interface) to make a recording.</description>

							<description>A nanohive is a nanocybernetic implant designed to support and coordinate nanoware in a living body long-term. Nanohives not only contain the hardware and software necessary to aid the functions of multiple nanoware colonies, but they also provide a safe environment for nanoware systems to repair, replicate, and resupply. As part of nanohive implantation procedures, a host of other minor cybernetic modifications are made to pre-existing organs including the liver, kidneys, and spleen. These alterations keep the body from filtering out nanites like other waste and cellular "detritus." Nanohives themselves replace and repair nanites that are excreted or damaged by the body, maintaining nanite populations at a normal level and even restoring depleted levels after injury. Combined with the filtration systems and the robustness of current nanotech, this limits natural nanite loss.

Each nanohive is a sealed egg-shaped implant containing the primary processor, controllers, and neural interfaces and is implanted near arterial or lymphatic junctions. In addition to the expert system(s), a nanohive incorporates sensors that monitor nanite levels in the blood, as well as reservoirs of feedstocks that support machinery for additional nanite colonies, and several thousand backup nanite units are present in ancillary pods. When the nanoware supported by a nanohive has its Rating reduced, the nanohive returns its Rating by 1 point per week, up to the nanohive's Rating.

Each nanohive supports one nanoware system at a Rating equal to its own.

Hard Nanohive: Hard nanohives are able to communicate and direct the actions of nanoware via shortrange ultrasound, microwave, or UV signals using the nanites themselves as relays. Hard nanohives can use this communication to reprogram the nanite system it supports - its Rating is the number of different hard nanite systems to which it can convert its nanites. Hard nanohives must be restocked every six months at a cost of 500 nuyen x Rating.</description>

A Rating 1 nanotattoo covers one limb or the face, Rating 2 covers half the body, and Rating 3 covers the whole body. A nanotattoo (or "nanotat") can be reprogrammed to display any image the user wishes, including preprogrammed animation.

						<item name="Radar Sensor (Alphaware)" essencecost="0.4" rating="2" wireless="Present">
							<description>Consisting of a terahertz pulse-transmitter, receiver, and highly advanced processing unit, this unit computes differences in the Doppler shift between the user and the surrounding area, within a twenty-meter radius. This allows the user to view a three-dimensional map of the area and the elements contained therein, if in a vague, blocky manner. The radio pulses are able to pass through most solid matter, allowing the user to "look" through walls, clothes, and similar obstructions to see the outlines of what lies beyond. While individuals cannot be recognized at the resolution of the processing, shapes can give some suggestion of what items might be (tables, guns, balls, and so forth). The system is excellent at detecting motion, calculating exact distance (when combined with a math SPU), and accurately overseeing floorplans and the locations of persons and objects in that area. It is somewhat complex to sift through the data for a proper reading (a Simple Action is required), and while it can ignore Invisibility spells (but not Improved Invisibility spells) and many camouflage methods, it cannot discern color, lighting, or texture.

The radar sensor uses the same Visibility modifiers as ultrasound but can penetrate a cumulative Structure Rating equal to its own Rating x 5. Thus, a Rating 2 radar sensor can penetrate two Rating 5 walls, or a single Rating 10 wall, or three Rating 3 walls, etc. Radar systems are especially vulnerable to jamming and noise, suffering double the usual disruption. Radar pulses are detectable by any wireless device, but most won't be able to identify them as anything more than background noise.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.</description>

						<description>While armored clothing is effective enough, and armored vests are fairly well hidden, it takes truly advanced craftsmanship to produce form-fitting body armor. Each suit is tailor-made to its wearer, leaving neither gaps nor folds while still allowing the body to breathe. The basic piece of armor is a shirt, covering the body from collarbone to groin, protecting the vital organs, while the full suit adds protection for the limbs. In either case, the hands, feet, and head are left exposed, as covering them gives away the fact that armor is being worn.

Form-fitting body armor can be worn under armor, but doing so won't change your protection much. The primary benefit of FFBA is its highly concealable.</description>

						<description>Can't resist throwing on the little tag line just so we remember who's in charge of this line. A few years back these lines were hot, but they've been adding feature after feature since then so that the things are getting pretty unwieldy. The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.

I'll admit I loved Manhunt, that remake of the old flatvid with the alien hunting a bunch of mercenaries in the jungle. This stuff makes me think of that trid every time I activate our display. It's high-tech camouflage at its finest. Add this to your favorite outfit and be ready to blend in anywhere.</description>

Even when you aren’t wearing the right outfit for a situation, you can look like you are.

This modification can be added to any armor or clothing, but it only gains its full benefits when applied to pieces that cover the wearer's whole body, like full body armors or cloaks. The ruthenium polymers are controlled by a sensor suite incorporated into the armor or clothing that scans the surroundings and replicates images of the area at the proper perspectives, helping the wearer blend in. The effectiveness is based on the Rating of the sensor suite and the extent of the suit's coverage. The base modifier to a Perception Test to spot the wearer is - (Rating), adjusted by the extent of the suit; full +0, almost full +1, half +2.</description>

								<description>This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social camouflage. Even when you aren’t wearing the right outfit for a situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes) with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).</description>

								<description>Items that are Custom Fit were measured for a specific person. They are specially designed for that person and don't fit well on anyone else, therefore conferring none of the positive Social Limit adjustments to the character. When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

					<item name="Datachip" quantity="10" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Datachip: For occasions when you want to transfer data by physical means - like bringing the project specs on the competition's new cyberdeck to Mr. Johnson in person at the meet - a datachip can hold enormous quantitites of data in a small finger-sized chip, accessible by any electronic device. Datachips have no wireless capability, so you need to plug them into a universal data connector (found on any device) if you want to read or write to them.</description>

					<item name="Linguasoft: English" rating="4" dicepool="0" quantity="1">
						<description>A skillsoft program is a recorded skill - digital knowledge and muscle memory. When used in conjunction with the proper augmentations (a skilljack for knowsofts and linguasofts, and a skillwire system for activesofts) skillsofts let you know and do things you've never otherwise learned. Even kung fu.

Skillsofts aren't educational tools; you can't actually learn from them. They're highly favored by corporations interested in a cheaper labor force (when the difference between a skilled and unskilled worker can be as simple as slotting a chip, the difference in salary is smaller).

When a skill test is called for, the character may use the skillsoft rating in place of the skill. Downside: tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way.

Linguasofts: Linguasofts replicate language skills, allowing a user to speak a foreign language by automatically translating signals from the speech cortex, although chipped speech can be awkward and stilted - then again, so can anyone speaking a language that's not their native tongue. Linguasofts must be accessed with a skilljack, which limits how many skillsofts you can use at a time.</description>

						<description>Originally developed by Shiawase Biotech but now available from several corps, these advanced medkits combine cutting-edge nanotech and advanced expert systems. When activated, the medkit injects enough nanites to last five minutes into its subject. The savior then acts as a Rating 6 medkit and follows all the normal rules for medkits (p. 450, SR5). If the patient is bleeding out, the savior's nanites act as a trauma control system (p. 148) for the duration. The savior's supply of nanites is limited, and it must be restocked every time it is used.

Trauma Control System
This nanoware system seeks out and gathers around vital organs. Some component nanites apply electro-stimulation to the heart and respiratory muscles, while others regulate blood flow away from wounds without starving the brain of oxygen. While you're busy dying from overflow damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, the TCS attempts to stabilize you every minute, using its Rating in place of both First Aid and Logic in the Stabilization Test (p. 209, SR5).</description>

						<description>Originally developed by Shiawase Biotech, but now available from several corps, these advanced medkits combine cutting edge nanotech and advanced expert systems. When activated, the medkit injects a mixture of diagnostic and repair nanites into the bloodstream, as well as the standard stimulants, coagulants, and painkillers. The integral expert system directs the nanites to rejoin damaged tissue, stop blood loss, and minimize the onset of shock.

The Savior is a Rating 6 medkit and follows all the normal rules for medkits (see p. 329, SR4). It also provides a +3 dice pool modifier to Body Tests to stabilize critical wounds. The Savior's supply of nanites is limited and it must be restocked every 2 uses (or in the event of a glitch).</description>

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they're used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.</description>

					<item name="Tag Eraser" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.</description>

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

				<attribute name="Reaction" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

				<attribute name="Strength" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="15" minimum="4" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>

				<attribute name="Willpower" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="2" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				<attribute name="Charisma" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane.

					<npcinfo name="Description">A metaspecies of the komodo dragon, the basilisk averages approximately 250 centimeters from its snout to the tip of its tail, and weighing around one hundred kilograms. They stand about twenty centimeters at the shoulder, are somewhat broader than their progenitor, and have a spiny dorsal fan, about thirty centimeters in height at its tallest point, running most of their length. Their scales are heavy; coloration is black and bright yellow, with a solid black snout and tail tip. Their maws are filled with sharp, saw-edged teeth that are constantly replaced as they're lost. Not surprisingly, they're aggressively carnivorous, typically feeding on fish and small mammals. They cheerfully glut themselves on anything they can catch, though, up to and including metahumans.

Extremely territorial, they are relatively easy to train and are used extensively as guard animals by a number of megacorps throughout the Sixth World.

Natural Habitat/Range: Native to Indonesia, basilisks can now be found in temperate and tropical woodlands worldwide. Powerful swimmers, their natural lairs are always near running water.</npcinfo>

Advantages: The assassin has honed his skills with firearms to the point where shots that would be tough for most people are second nature to him. Halve the cost of all Called Shots, meaning they impose only a -2 dice pool penalty instead of -4. The Called Shot still costs a Free Action.

Disadvantages: The standard "aiming for center mass" shots that most people take are beneath this sort of assassin. He seeks to make every shot count, regardless of how many bullets are in his magazine. The assassin must make Called Shots unless he is providing covering fire or acting in a similar capacity where Called Shots would not be practical.</description>

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Nationalist/Japan (7dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.

The Code of Honor can take other forms as well. For example:
• Assassin's Creed: A character never kills anyone that they are not paid to kill. Being precise as an assassin, not leaving collateral damage, and being invisible are important hallmarks of those who believe in the Assassin's Creed. Characters who take this version of Code of Honor lose 1 point of Karma for every unintentional and/or unpaid murder they commit, and their Public Awareness goes up by 1 for each such death.
• Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.</description>

					<quality name="Creature of Comfort (Middle Lifestyle)" rank="1">
						<description>For the character with this quality, the rewards of a job well done are the finer things in life. Unfortunately, one can quickly get attached to the comforts one has acquired, making the fall seem ever so higher. At the 10 Karma level, the character is used to a Middle Lifestyle, at the 17 level a High, and 25, it's Luxury all the way, baby.

For every day that the character must spend "slumming" it in a lower Lifestyle category, the irritable character suffers a -1 penalty to all Social and Healing tests per Lifestyle category below his chosen level. For example, if the character takes this Quality at the High Lifestyle level and is forced to stay in a Squatter Lifestyle, he will suffer -3 to all Social and Healing tests.

						<description>The adept has learned to cast a single spell like a mage. You learn one spell for free when acquiring this power. The maximum Force of the spell is your Magic Rating, and the Drain is always physical, resisted with Body + Willpower. This ability otherwise follows the standard rules for spellcasting. The adept can take ranks in the Spellcasting skill and is required to take at least one rank to use this power. This power can only be taken once.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Attribute Boost (4): Agility (10dicepool)" name="Attribute Boost (10dicepool)" rating="4">
						<description>You call upon inner strength to perform amazing physical feats beyond their normal abilities. Attribute Boost must be purchased for a specific Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction, or Strength); separate Attribute Boost powers may be bought for different attributes. This power cannot be purchased for a Mental or Special Attribute.

When you activate this power, make a Magic + Attribute Boost Rating Test. Each hit on this test boosts your attribute rating by 1, up to your augmented Attribute maximum. This only affects your dice pools; your Physical limit and Initiative ratings don't change with Attribute Boost. The boost lasts for a number of Combat Turns equal to twice the number of hits you get. When the boost runs out, you take Drain equal to the level of this power.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Freefall (4)" name="Freefall" rating="4">
						<description>This power helps adepts absorb the damage from a fall or jump down for a specific distance. This ability does not help the adept increase the distance he is jumping, such as with the Light Body power. Every level of Freefall allows the adept to fall or jump down 3 additional meters without any adverse effects (beyond the three meters normally allowed). When calculating fall damage past his personal distance threshold, subtract the overall level bonus from the Damage Value of the fall and then apply damage normally (see p. 172, SR5). This means that an adept with Freefall receives no damage from a fall of six meters or less, rather than the typical three meters. Beyond that, if an adept with two levels of Freefall falls 15 meters, the power negates 6 points of damage from the fall, changing the Damage Value of the fall from 15P to 9P (the fall's AP remains unchanged). As long as the adept experiences no damage from the fall (either because the fall was short enough to cause no damage or because they successfully resisted all applicable damage using Body + Armor, the fall counts as a normal move action, and can be combined with an attack. Any other means of dealing with the damage does not allow this opportunity. Longer falls count as a Complex Action.</description>

					<adeptpower text="Hang Time (1)" name="Hang Time" rating="1">
						<description>Adepts with this power receive two benefits. First, for each level of this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for all Climbing Tests. Second, the adept can temporarily adhere to surfaces, such as walls. For each level of this power, the adept can attach himself to a surface and hang out for approximately five minutes, provided he remains motionless and keeps physical contact with the surface in question with hands, feet, knees, or elbows. The adept must spend a Simple Action to bond his magical energy with the surface; normal clothing such as gloves or boots does not interfere with this power, but the use of heavy armor (armor with a Rating of 13 or higher) will. Moving the attached body parts on the surface they're adhering to, such as a moving vehicle, breaks the bond, making the adept fall off.</description>

						<description>One of the most rugged and certainly the heaviest (in terms of weight) pistols on the market, the Striker is simplicity personified. Designed for ease of use, the Striker lacks any of the electronics that modern pistols employ, making it immune to hacking and malware. With its striker fire design and backstrap safety, there are no external hammers or levers, making for a sleek design that won’t snag on your clothes when it’s needed. The comparatively low cost of the Striker makes it an ideal choice for people who aren’t yet ready to make the financial commitment that higher-end models require—it was this year’s most popular quinceañera gift in its category.

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test.

						<description>Not to be confused with good ol’ Stick-n-Shock, these rounds actually cause damage to electronic systems, rather than the electronics themselves. Using a mix of wireless data burst broadcasting tech and dense IC coding, the round attacks the object in the “Matrix.” Why the quotes? Glad you asked, because early models were useless once you shut the wireless off on your device. But that’s not the case after the redesign. Now, as long as your device is active and capable of accessing the Matrix, even if the receiver is currently shut down, the contact protocols in the rounds do the job as long as you’re a good shot.

Here’s what I mean. Use these on someone actively connected, hidden or not, and you can pretty much hit anywhere on their person and something is gonna get popped. The coding latches onto the first device it can break through and then folds and repeats inside, using its limited power to pull off its effect. Mass effect versions that scramble and frag up everything are in the works, but for now you’ll only find that bit of gear terrorism over in the grenades department.

Now, if you’re a solid shot, you can bullseye something specific and you can pretty much guarantee the code’s concentrated enough to drill into that single piece. More than one decker has been unprepared for one of these hitting their deck. Most decks have better protection than your average armored jacket and they might be able to take the hit, but get tagged while you were planning to sleaze in rather than take on IC and you just might be taking pointers from the street sam about how to stay useful in the fight. Of course, he might be slowed down to your speed, because his wires got tagged too.

Zapper Round Rules
Rather than doing normal damage, these bullets do Matrix Damage. The standard ranged attack roll is made with damage increased by net hits and applied to a single device possessed, worn, carried, or implanted in the targeted individual. The device receiving the damage is selected at random by the gamemaster, or by the attacking player if they succeed in a Called Shot. Devices can only be targeted by a Called Shot if they are visible to the attacker. Damage Resistance roll is made using the Device Rating + Firewall, along with any other damage resistance programs.

Burst Fire and Full Auto have an alternate option. Instead of hindering the target’s Defense Test, the attack strikes multiple devices, or one device more than once. Burst Fire hits twice, Long Burst hits three times, and Full Auto hits four times.</description>

						<description>Can't resist throwing on the little tag line just so we remember who's in charge of this line. A few years back these lines were hot, but they've been adding feature after feature since then so that the things are getting pretty unwieldy. The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.

I'll admit I loved Manhunt, that remake of the old flatvid with the alien hunting a bunch of mercenaries in the jungle. This stuff makes me think of that trid every time I activate our display. It's high-tech camouflage at its finest. Add this to your favorite outfit and be ready to blend in anywhere.</description>

This modification can be added to any armor or clothing, but it only gains its full benefits when applied to pieces that cover the wearer's whole body, like full body armors or cloaks. The ruthenium polymers are controlled by a sensor suite incorporated into the armor or clothing that scans the surroundings and replicates images of the area at the proper perspectives, helping the wearer blend in. The effectiveness is based on the Rating of the sensor suite and the extent of the suit's coverage. The base modifier to a Perception Test to spot the wearer is - (Rating), adjusted by the extent of the suit; full +0, almost full +1, half +2.</description>

						<description>The goal of this system is to avoid those situations where your mates are chewing you out for accidentally shooting them in the hoop. Using information about your teammates' appearance and the electronics in their PAN, this system attempts to recognize when you are aiming at any spot within 1 meter of a friendly target. In these situations, the system locks the trigger, preventing you from firing. Once the friendly target isn't at risk anymore, you can start firing again. Note that the system interprets risk broadly - if there is something between you and a friendly target, the system will lock you out, unless that "something" is an entire office building or Mt. Rushmore or something.

The basic system can mark up to 10 RFID profiles (or GPS coordinates if you want to designate fixed locations as "safe"); for a few extra nuyen you can add more profiles. If you want a little more accuracy, allowing you to easily shoot the drekhead who stole your buddy's commlink without difficulty, then upgrade to the image recognition system. You'll need a guncam or smartlink to use this function. The base image recognition allows you to enter up to 10 different visual profiles, which can be as broad as "anyone wearing the Ancients' logo" or as narrow as precise scans of members of your team. As with the GPS/RFID system, you can spring for extra profiles if you need them.

The safe target system can be mounted on any location besides the stock.</description>

A shop is transportable in the back of a van and contains more advanced tools for building and repairing. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

						<description>With the popular nanopaste disguise kit falling in popularity due to CFD concerns, the synthskin facemask has taken its market share. It is composed of a programmable electropolymer commonly used in the skin covering of synthetic cyberware and humanoid mimic drones. It produces a lifelike replica of an individual's face. A person's face can be duplicated if you have a scan from a biometric reader (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the biometric reader's Rating). A Software + Logic Test (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the successes) can replicate a specific individual's face or create a completely unique appearance. In either case, the limit on the test is equal to the Rating of the mask. The mask is reusable in the sense that it can be worn multiple times, but once an appearance has been set in either fashion described above, it cannot be altered.</description>

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>

				<attribute name="Agility" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

				<attribute name="Reaction" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

				<attribute name="Strength" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="5" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>

					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				<attribute name="Charisma" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Gearhead">
						<description>The Gearhead is who you look for when it's time to stomp on the gas and move. She's a natural-born driver or pilot. When she's at the wheel/stick/controls of a vehicle or drone, she has an intuitive understanding of its limitations and its capabilities and is able to coax whatever machine she's controlling to perform at its best. During vehicle or chase combat, a Gearhead can increase the Speed or the Handling of her vehicle or drone by +1 (player’s choice) for 1D6 minutes. She also receives a +2 dice pool modifier when attempting difficult maneuvers or stunts in the vehicle. This bonus lasts for 1D6 minutes. The player can choose to make this bonus last up to an additional 1D6 minutes if she wants. Doing so pushes the vehicle or drone well beyond its design limits and risks catastrophic damage. For each minute the character pushes the vehicle past its initial bonus period, the vehicle automatically takes one point of stress damage (unresisted)</description>

					<quality name="Hawk Eye" useradded="no">
						<description>Characters with the Hawk Eye quality have exceptionally keen natural vision. They can identify a face a block away without binoculars or spot a spent casing in a shadowy crack at five meters. Characters gain a +1 dice pool modifier to their Perception Tests and shift all Range Environmental modifiers up one category (e.g., Medium becomes Short). The quality is part of characters' natural eyes and is not compatible with electronic vision enhancements and/or cyber- or bioware augmentations or replacements.</description>

					<quality name="Mentor Spirit: Raven (Alt)">
						<description>Everyone needs some help in life, even if it comes from someone relatively filmy and insubstantial. Mentor Spirit means the character follows a patron spirit (see Mentor Spirits, p. 320) that guides him in his practice of magic and provides certain advantages and disadvantages to his natural abilities. A character may change mentor spirits, but he may have only one mentor spirit at a time. To change mentor spirits, the character must first buy off the current mentor spirit as if it were a Negative quality. He can then purchase the quality again to follow a different mentor spirit. This cost represents the toll of divorcing from one mentor spirit and bonding with a new one.

Each tradition has a different name for a mentor spirit. Hermetic mages prefer the term "mentor spirit," while shamans use the word "totem" for the spirit that they follow. While the names may vary, the way the mentor works is consistent.

This quality is only available to characters that possess a Magic attribute rating.</description>

					<quality name="Restricted Gear: Control Rig (Deltaware)">
						<description>Right place, right time, right friend, or the stars aligned. No matter the reason, the character has managed to acquire or get a line on one piece of really hard-to-find gear she absolutely had to have. The character can take this quality up to three times; only one of those times can occur at character creation. Selecting it at character creation allows the character to buy a piece of gear with an Availability of up to 24 (circumventing the normal Availability limit at character creation). After character creation, taking this quality lets the character purchase one piece of gear with an Availability up to 18 during play with just a single commcall. They do, however, have to pay an extra thirty percent for the item.</description>

					<quality name="Sioux Aspected Magician (Conjuring)">
						<description>• Aspected magicians are a limited form of magician.

• Aspected magicians do not astrally project.

• Aspected magicians can astrally perceive.

• Aspected magicians must choose one, and only one, of the following three Skills/Skill Groups.

• Sorcery (Spellcasting and related skills) • Conjuring (Summoning and related skills) • Enchanting (Alchemy and related skills) • Aspected magicians cannot perform any of the magical skills associated with the two groups they did not select.

• Aspected magicians can only learn Counterspelling if they take the skills to be a spellcaster.

• Aspected magicians can follow mentor spirits.

• At character creation, aspected magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).</description>

					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Hawk" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Compulsive (Specific Public) (2): Kleptomania" rank="2">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Compulsive (4 To 12 Karma): There is an order to all things that must be maintained, and the character feels the need to exert their sense of order on everything. The value of this mental malady comes from how severe the compulsion is and how much of a negative impact it can have on the character. Maybe she likes a tidy house, maybe she sees a necessary order to the items on the tables out in the world, or maybe she feels the need to practice her skills (be they hacking, casting, shooting, talking, stealing, sneaking, etc.) every chance she gets. The character must make a Composure (2) test to resist the compulsion. The base Karma value is (2 x threshold needed for Composure Test; must be from 1 to 4); then add 2 for things in the character's personal environment (e.g., placement of furniture and minor appliances), 3 for a single aspect of the public environment (e.g., correcting bad apostrophes on signs, counting every Ford Americar they see), or 4 for a broad aspect of the public environment (e.g., touching every light post they walk by, hacking into every camera they see).</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Spirit Bane: Spirits of Earth">
						<description>A character with a Spirit Bane really torques off a certain type of spirit (p. 303). Whether the character has a reputation for harming this sort of spirit or something about her aura enrages them, spirits of the type affected by the Spirit Bane are likely to harass the character when she is in their presence, and they may be reluctant to obey or perform favors for the character or her friends. If spirits of this type are ordered to attack a party that includes the character, these spirits will single her out and attempt to destroy her first. Affected spirits will always use lethal force against these characters with the Spirit Bane quality. If the character with Spirit Bane tries to summon or bind this spirit, she suffers a -2 dice pool modifier for the attempt. If the summoner tries to banish a spirit of this type, the spirit receives a +2 dice pool modifier for resisting her attempt. Watchers and minions do not count for Spirit Bane, as they are constructs that are not summoned like normal spirits.

This quality may only be taken by magic users. Magic users may possess this quality for a type of spirit that is not a part of their magical tradition.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it's like getting a free datajack). When you're jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Speed of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), again when you're jumped in.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

						<description>Concealed as mundane items like buttons, earrings, necklaces, pins, and other baubles and bobs, these devices function as Sensor Tags (p. 440, SR5). These items have a Concealability modifier of –6 in respect to determining their true nature.

Sensor Tags
These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Sensor Tags: A sensor RFID tag can be equipped with a single sensor (sold separately) of up to Rating 2 (Sensors, p. 445). It then records everything it can, to a maximum of 24 hours of time, at which point you can program it to either shut off or overwrite data older than 24 hours. Sensor tags are often used for diagnostic purposes in various devices, including cyberware.</description>

You can put sensors in just about everything, and lots of people do. Your can of FizzyGoo is watching you and reporting back to marketing. You can play the sensor game, too.

Sensors need to be placed in a housing or case of some sort, or built into another device. Sensors can record data themselves or forward it wirelessly in real-time or as files to other devices. Sensors are available in seven ratings (2-8) and two types: single and array. When you use the sensor array for Perception Tests, you may use your Electronic Warfare skill in place of your Perception skill, and you may use the sensor's Rating as your limit.

Single sensor: This is a sensor that can do only one function listed under Sensor Functions.</description>

The directional jammer affects a conical area with a 30-degree spread - its rating is reduced by 1 for every 20 meters from the center. The jammer only affects devices (and personas on those devices) that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them. Walls and other obstacles may prevent the jamming signal from spreading or reduce its effect (gamemaster's discretion).</description>

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they're used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.</description>

						<description>What do you do with a lot of relatively stupid drones? Create one reasonably smart swarm! A drone (or vehicle) swarm is a network of linked drones all slaved (p. 233, SR5) to a single RCC running the Swarm program. You can include as many drones in a swarm as your RCC can slave (Device Rating x 3), or split them up among several swarms (again, limited by your RCC's slave limit). To start a swarm, simply run the Swarm program on your RCC, slave your drones, and command them to join the swarm you designate for them.

Each swarm acts as a single drone with multiple, separate "bodies." Its Pilot rating is equal to the highest Pilot rating of its member drones, or the Device Rating of the RCC, whichever is higher. The swarm uses the highest- rated of each autosoft running on any drone or the RCC, and the highest Sensor rating. It uses the lowest of the drones' Handling, Speed, and Acceleration ratings. When performing actions, the swarm gets a dice pool and limit bonus equal to one less than the number of drones in the swarm.

In combat, all drones attack with whatever weapons they have, but for game purposes only use a single weapon's stats (the others are covered by the action bonuses the swarm receives), although roll scatter for explosive weapons separately. Drones in a swarm must be targeted individually by attackers - the loss of drones from a swarm due to damage, hacking, or other mishaps affects the swarm's bonuses and ratings immediately.

Note: The effects of this program have not been implemented yet.</description>

						<description>This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.</description>

					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

				<attribute name="Initiate Grade" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians and adepts will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation allows a character to wield greater magical abilities known as metamagic, access the metaplanes of astral space (p. 191), and raise her Magic attribute beyond her natural maximum of 6. Only characters with the Magician, Adept, or Mystic Adept qualities may initiate. Initiation is a serious process that requires a great deal of mental and spiritual preparation in the form of rituals or study appropriate to the character's tradition. A mage might spend months in research on a particular point of magic, writing a scholarly thesis in order to prepare, while a shaman might undergo a vision quest and seek guidance from her mentor spirit.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character's first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way.

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Karma points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.

A character's initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character's Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.</description>

					<quality name="College Education">
						<description>The halls of academe are well known to your character. Thanks to time spent actually studying while at college instead of partying, the character can buy Academic Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Academic Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.</description>

					<quality name="Gifted Healer: Stabilization">
						<description>A character with the Gifted Healer quality is particularly adept at one of the three tests detailed in the Care Under Fire optional rules (Stabilization, Diagnosis, or Treatment, p. 14). She receives a +1 dice pool bonus whenever performing the selected test, whether by magical or mundane means. Gifted Healer may only be taken once, meaning a character can only get the bonus for a single test, not two or three.</description>

					<quality name="Grease Monkey">
						<description>When you were young, you would much rather make a trip to the junkyard than the toy store (possibly because kids in the barrens never have enough money to buy anything at the toy store). As you got older, the allure or discarded vehicle and machine parts on the heaps in junkyards was far stronger than the promise of some new toy. You not only loved monkeying around with these items, but you could often get the devices to work. Gain +1 dice on any skill test using skills from the Engineering skill group.</description>

					<quality name="Hawk Eye" useradded="no">
						<description>Characters with the Hawk Eye quality have exceptionally keen natural vision. They can identify a face a block away without binoculars or spot a spent casing in a shadowy crack at five meters. Characters gain a +1 dice pool modifier to their Perception Tests and shift all Range Environmental modifiers up one category (e.g., Medium becomes Short). The quality is part of characters' natural eyes and is not compatible with electronic vision enhancements and/or cyber- or bioware augmentations or replacements.</description>

					<quality name="Sioux Magician">
						<description>• Magicians can astrally perceive.

• Magicians can astrally project.

• Magicians can choose freely from the magical skills or skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, Enchanting).

• Magicians can cast spells, conjure spirits, or enchant magical items.

• At character creation, magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).</description>

					<quality name="Spirit Whisperer">
						<description>There is something about you that makes some spirits want to avoid you - while others seem oddly drawn to you. Spirits add 1 die when resisting Summoning Tests from characters with this quality. However, if the character succeeds in the test, the spirit summoned is always at 1 point of Force stronger than chosen. For all purposes, the character is considered to have summoned the spirit at the declared Force - it simply shows up at 1 point of Force higher than expected. Summoned spirits behave rather curiously toward the character, asking questions about the character's past, though no amount of mastery can compel them to reveal why they are so curious and why they show up stronger than summoned (the gamemaster should play up this mystery; it could even be the basis of an eventual campaign).</description>

					<quality name="Albinism" rank="2">
						<description>While the little white bunnies are cute, a character with this quality will likely get a moniker like Powder, Whitey, or Snowflake. Albinism is a genetic disorder that results in a partial or complete lack of pigmentation in the eyes, skin, and hair. While the lack of pigment in the hair and skin results in white colorations, lack of pigment in the eyes results in pink or crystal blue irises, with bright red pupils. Due to the lack of melanin, the compound that provides the pigmentation, characters with this quality lack ultraviolet light protection, making them very photosensitive and prone to sunburn. All ethnicities, metatypes, and metavariants can manifest albinism; in fact, all species can manifest albinism, including sapient paracritters.

Characters with this quality face a Weak Glare penalty to all actions when working in regular indoor lighting as well as during a bright but overcast day, and a Moderate Glare penalty when working on a sunny day. All other Glare modifiers are also increased by one level versus albino characters. Normal compensation methods work to mitigate the modifiers.

Due to the lack of protective pigmentation in their skin, characters with this quality suffer sunburn more quickly. Halve the duration between resistance tests when exposed to the sun for extended periods (p. 148, Run &amp; Gun).

Characters who gain cybereyes at any point in the character creation process only gain 4 Karma at character creation. If an albino character gains cybereyes during game play, they must buy down this quality to the 4 Karma level as soon as they have the Karma, and cannot spend Karma on anything else until the quality is bought down.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Distinctive Style: Albino + Head scars">
						<description>A character with the Distinctive Style quality has at least one aspect of his appearance, mannerism, or personality that makes him inconveniently memorable. Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what's distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.

Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This quality is physical in nature and does not apply to astral searches. This quality may only be taken once. This quality is incompatible with Blandness.</description>
						<traitcost bp="0"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Low Pain Tolerance">
						<description>Characters with Low Pain Tolerance are particularly sensitive to pain; they incur a -1 wound modifier for every 2 boxes of cumulative damage, instead of the normal 3 boxes. This affects both Physical and Stun damage tracks.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-9"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Hawks" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Compulsive (Specific Public) (2): Kleptomania" rank="2">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Compulsive (4 To 12 Karma): There is an order to all things that must be maintained, and the character feels the need to exert their sense of order on everything. The value of this mental malady comes from how severe the compulsion is and how much of a negative impact it can have on the character. Maybe she likes a tidy house, maybe she sees a necessary order to the items on the tables out in the world, or maybe she feels the need to practice her skills (be they hacking, casting, shooting, talking, stealing, sneaking, etc.) every chance she gets. The character must make a Composure (2) test to resist the compulsion. The base Karma value is (2 x threshold needed for Composure Test; must be from 1 to 4); then add 2 for things in the character's personal environment (e.g., placement of furniture and minor appliances), 3 for a single aspect of the public environment (e.g., correcting bad apostrophes on signs, counting every Ford Americar they see), or 4 for a broad aspect of the public environment (e.g., touching every light post they walk by, hacking into every camera they see).</description>

					<spell name="Armor" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armor equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armor. It is not included in any calculations to determine armor encumbrance (see Armor and Encumbrance, p. 169).</description>

					<spell name="Fix" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F" drainvalue="+0" duration="Permanent" type="Physical" range="Touch" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>Most spellcasters have devoted their efforts towards learning spells rather than mechanics. This can leave a magician in a bad situation when there is a need for an emergency repair during a run. Fix allows the spellcaster to repair damage to non-living materials, including drones and vehicles. The caster must first touch the object and then achieve enough hits to beat the item's Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5).

Fix can repair any item with a weight equal to the Force x the spellcaster's hits in kilograms or less. This spell can only repair broken items when all the pieces are present. The weight limit applies to the damaged part, not necessarily the entire vehicle. For example, if you have a busted wheel, you would count that weight not the weight of the entire vehicle. Each hit scored repairs 1 point of Structure rating or 1 box of damage. An object may only be affected by Fix once and thereafter may not be repaired again by this spell.</description>

					<spell name="Heal" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-4" drainvalue="-4" duration="Permanent" type="Mana" range="Touch" category="Health" subcat="Essence-Dependant Health Spell">
						<description>Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell's hits from the Spellcasting Test. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.</description>

					<spell name="Invisibility" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Mana" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Illusion" subcat="Realistic Illusion Spell,Single-Sense Illusion Spell">
						<description>This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she's good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject's surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</description>

					<spell name="Magic Fingers" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect as a sort of invisible hand that can hold or manipulate items. The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell's effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell's Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster's discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the "hands" can't be farther away from each other than your arm span). This spell comes in very handy (no pun intended) for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.</description>

					<spell name="Silence" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-1" drainvalue="-1" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Illusion" subcat="Area,Realistic Illusion Spell,Single-Sense Illusion Spell">
						<description>These spells create an area that dampens sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by -1 per hit on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.</description>

						<description>When applied to a character with a filled Physical damage track, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell's Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become permanent before the character is truly stabilized; hits reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow (p. 209).</description>

						<description>You learn to change the appearance of your aura (and astral form). You can make it look mundane, or make your Magic Rating look higher or lower by up to your grade. When someone tries to read your masked aura, the Assensing Test becomes opposed by your Magic + initiate grade - if they get any net hits, they see both your mask and your real aura.

If you can use astral perception, you can even make your aura look like a different type (like a spirit or a focus - great for astral costume parties). You can also use this metamagic to mask the auras of as many of your bonded foci as your initiate grade.</description>

								<description>Items that are Custom Fit were measured for a specific person. They are specially designed for that person and don't fit well on anyone else, therefore conferring none of the positive Social Limit adjustments to the character. When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

					<item name="Magical Lodge Materials" rating="3" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>A magical lodge is a stationary collection of symbols, writings, tools, fetishes, and other mystical materials that helps spellcasters record their lore, expand their talent, and practice magic. It's a basic tool of magicians across the world, about the size of a room. You need it to learn spells, perform rituals, craft foci, and in a pinch you can use it to protect yourself from magical threats. Each lodge is of a specific tradition - a shamanic lodge is intended for shamans, and a hermetic lodge for mages.

Magical lodges don't always look like lodges per se. A shamanic lodge is a traditional medicine lodge, but a hermetic magician's lodge is a series of magic circles, shelves filled with arcane tomes, mystical mechanisms, and alchemical apparatuses. Every tradition has its own version of a magical lodge, but they all work the same way.

Magical lodges aren't intended to be portable (although you can make a temporary one with reagents, p. 316). To create your own, you need magical lodge materials (they cost Force x 500 nuyen) that are appropriate to your tradition. Once you have the materials, find a space to put it, like your apartment, or a cave in the wilderness, or a secret abandoned sewer tunnel - someplace you won't mind spending some time. Then spend a number of days equal to the lodge's Force dedicating the space, setting up the physical components, building its astral form, setting up barriers, and harmonizing it to your aura. Once you're done, your magical lodge is up and active. An active magical lodge acts as a mana barrier (p. 315) and shares your astral signature.

If you want to move your lodge, you'll need a day to take it down, turning it back into magical lodge materials; then you can set it up again somewhere else. If you want to improve your lodge, just bring in more materials to add to the current ones and spend a day times the Force you want the lodge to have at the end of your work.</description>

A person's face can be duplicated if you have a scan from a biometric reader (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the biometric reader's Rating). A Software + Logic Test (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the successes) can replicate a specific individual's face or create a completely unique appearance. In either case, the limit on the test is equal to the Rating of the mask. The mask is reusable in the sense that it can be worn multiple times, but once an appearance has been set in either fashion described above, it cannot be altered.</description>
