Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.\n\nWhile denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the \"uncanny valley\" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.",

Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action (Ready Weapon, p. 165).\n\nBows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffers a -3 dice pool modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. The weapon's Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow's rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.\n\nA compound bow cannot use the Overdraw action due to the nature of the pulley system it uses. The benefit of a compound bow is that the pulley system makes it extremely easy to hold the bow drawn, allowing an archer to maintain a Take Aim action for (Body x 4) Combat Turns. A compound bow can also mount a smartlink, as the pulley system gives the projectiles a fixed velocity.\n\nWith any bow or crossbow, a laser sight is ineffective at any range beyond Short due to parabolic nature of the projectiles. Unless you somehow get a laser that also travels in a parabola. Which you can't.",

The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.\n\nIf you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.\n\nRetrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test.

Able to switch between long-range fire against a single hard armored target (such as a dragon) or firing bursts against clusters (such as drakes), it was seen as a weapon that could be issued to entire squads. Not mass produced, but produced enough that cost trumped quality in many ways, the final result is a sort of super-sized assault rifle rather than the kind of high-quality precision design that Saeder-Krupp is world famous for.",

								"description": "Max Value: 5,000¥\nCash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.\n\nEach type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.",

								"description": "One of the biggest troubles runners have is with the uniforms they are required to wear for their disguise and cover story. The details about the uniforms should be exactly right to avoid tipping people off. There are fixers out there that specialize in acquiring uniforms for such jobs (usually fenced to them by runners following successful runs when they picked this stuff up) and selling them to runners. Your fixer may be one of them, or if not, he likely knows someone else who deals in these disguises. Get to know one of these fixers because they can do a lot for you. A truly talented disguise fixer will know precisely what gear you will need to sell the disguise (everything from the actual medical bags and kits that DocWagon medics use and carry around with them to the proper, authorized body armor and restraints used by Lone Star officers). They will know which uniforms wear chevrons and how many years of service each chevron depicts. They will understand the rank system that many medical and law enforcement professionals use, and can tell you how many chevrons your uniform needs if you are trying to pull off the look of a Knight Errant Lieutenant (at least three chevrons, BTW). They will be able to tell you how decorations are meant to be worn, and more importantly, in which order. For those that don’t know, Knight Errant officers wear their decorations over their badges when they are in their uniforms, but not when they are in their full body armor.\n\nThese fixers can also provide authentic badges for you to wear on these uniforms. Many law enforcement agencies and corporations still rely on metal badges as a time-honored tradition, though properly encrypted AROs are more common. Either element—the badge or the ID ARO—cannot be simply duplicated by a fashion spell. Most people won’t bother copying the badge number. They have been conditioned by the megacorporations over the years to blindly accept authority in all forms. So even if the badge was taken off a cop that had been killed in the line of duty, it should be sufficient to give you the time to get the job done (provided you don’t pass an observant cop in the hallway leading to your destination who happens to recognize the number).\n\nKnowing the dress codes for each organization is another essential, which any good fixer who specializes in these disguises will know. Knight Errant, for example, has started a new policy of requiring its beat cops to have cyberware with the synthetic coverings installed. So, if you’re pretending to be a Knight Errant cop and you have chrome showing, that could be a big tipoff that you aren’t who you say you are. Lone Star requires its cops to cover up all tattoos and body modifications. This is the information the right fixer can give you.",
