					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

				<attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				<attribute name="Intuition" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

				<attribute name="Magic" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Heritage???Special">
					<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Initiate Grade" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians and adepts will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation allows a character to wield greater magical abilities known as metamagic, access the metaplanes of astral space (p. 191), and raise her Magic attribute beyond her natural maximum of 6. Only characters with the Magician, Adept, or Mystic Adept qualities may initiate. Initiation is a serious process that requires a great deal of mental and spiritual preparation in the form of rituals or study appropriate to the character's tradition. A mage might spend months in research on a particular point of magic, writing a scholarly thesis in order to prepare, while a shaman might undergo a vision quest and seek guidance from her mentor spirit.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character's first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way.

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Karma points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.

A character's initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character's Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.</description>

					<quality name="College Education">
						<description>The halls of academe are well known to your character. Thanks to time spent actually studying while at college instead of partying, the character can buy Academic Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Academic Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.</description>
						<traitcost bp="4"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Gifted Healer: Stabilization">
						<description>A character with the Gifted Healer quality is particularly adept at one of the three tests detailed in the Care Under Fire optional rules (Stabilization, Diagnosis, or Treatment, p. 14). She receives a +1 dice pool bonus whenever performing the selected test, whether by magical or mundane means. Gifted Healer may only be taken once, meaning a character can only get the bonus for a single test, not two or three.</description>
						<traitcost bp="2"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Grease Monkey">
						<description>When you were young, you would much rather make a trip to the junkyard than the toy store (possibly because kids in the barrens never have enough money to buy anything at the toy store). As you got older, the allure or discarded vehicle and machine parts on the heaps in junkyards was far stronger than the promise of some new toy. You not only loved monkeying around with these items, but you could often get the devices to work. Gain +1 dice on any skill test using skills from the Engineering skill group.</description>
						<traitcost bp="8"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Hawk Eye" useradded="no">
						<description>Characters with the Hawk Eye quality have exceptionally keen natural vision. They can identify a face a block away without binoculars or spot a spent casing in a shadowy crack at five meters. Characters gain a +1 dice pool modifier to their Perception Tests and shift all Range Environmental modifiers up one category (e.g., Medium becomes Short). The quality is part of characters' natural eyes and is not compatible with electronic vision enhancements and/or cyber- or bioware augmentations or replacements.</description>

					<quality name="Sioux Magician">
						<description>• Magicians can astrally perceive.

• Magicians can astrally project.

• Magicians can choose freely from the magical skills or skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, Enchanting).

• Magicians can cast spells, conjure spirits, or enchant magical items.

• At character creation, magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Spirit Whisperer">
						<description>There is something about you that makes some spirits want to avoid you - while others seem oddly drawn to you. Spirits add 1 die when resisting Summoning Tests from characters with this quality. However, if the character succeeds in the test, the spirit summoned is always at 1 point of Force stronger than chosen. For all purposes, the character is considered to have summoned the spirit at the declared Force - it simply shows up at 1 point of Force higher than expected. Summoned spirits behave rather curiously toward the character, asking questions about the character's past, though no amount of mastery can compel them to reveal why they are so curious and why they show up stronger than summoned (the gamemaster should play up this mystery; it could even be the basis of an eventual campaign).</description>

					<quality name="Albinism" rank="2">
						<description>While the little white bunnies are cute, a character with this quality will likely get a moniker like Powder, Whitey, or Snowflake. Albinism is a genetic disorder that results in a partial or complete lack of pigmentation in the eyes, skin, and hair. While the lack of pigment in the hair and skin results in white colorations, lack of pigment in the eyes results in pink or crystal blue irises, with bright red pupils. Due to the lack of melanin, the compound that provides the pigmentation, characters with this quality lack ultraviolet light protection, making them very photosensitive and prone to sunburn. All ethnicities, metatypes, and metavariants can manifest albinism; in fact, all species can manifest albinism, including sapient paracritters.

Characters with this quality face a Weak Glare penalty to all actions when working in regular indoor lighting as well as during a bright but overcast day, and a Moderate Glare penalty when working on a sunny day. All other Glare modifiers are also increased by one level versus albino characters. Normal compensation methods work to mitigate the modifiers.

Due to the lack of protective pigmentation in their skin, characters with this quality suffer sunburn more quickly. Halve the duration between resistance tests when exposed to the sun for extended periods (p. 148, Run &amp; Gun).

Characters who gain cybereyes at any point in the character creation process only gain 4 Karma at character creation. If an albino character gains cybereyes during game play, they must buy down this quality to the 4 Karma level as soon as they have the Karma, and cannot spend Karma on anything else until the quality is bought down.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Distinctive Style: Albino + Head scars">
						<description>A character with the Distinctive Style quality has at least one aspect of his appearance, mannerism, or personality that makes him inconveniently memorable. Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what's distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.

Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This quality is physical in nature and does not apply to astral searches. This quality may only be taken once. This quality is incompatible with Blandness.</description>
						<traitcost bp="0"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Low Pain Tolerance">
						<description>Characters with Low Pain Tolerance are particularly sensitive to pain; they incur a -1 wound modifier for every 2 boxes of cumulative damage, instead of the normal 3 boxes. This affects both Physical and Stun damage tracks.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-9"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Hawks" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Poor Self Control - Compulsive (Specific Public) (2): Kleptomania" rank="2">
						<description>Whether they're a boaster, an adrenaline junkie, or just can't stand disorder, characters with this quality span a variety of mental ticks that all boil down to the inability to control one's actions. The Karma costs vary based on the threshold of the Composure test involved in restraining the character's actions. The quality can be taken multiple times, but only once for each form of control issue.

Compulsive (4 To 12 Karma): There is an order to all things that must be maintained, and the character feels the need to exert their sense of order on everything. The value of this mental malady comes from how severe the compulsion is and how much of a negative impact it can have on the character. Maybe she likes a tidy house, maybe she sees a necessary order to the items on the tables out in the world, or maybe she feels the need to practice her skills (be they hacking, casting, shooting, talking, stealing, sneaking, etc.) every chance she gets. The character must make a Composure (2) test to resist the compulsion. The base Karma value is (2 x threshold needed for Composure Test; must be from 1 to 4); then add 2 for things in the character's personal environment (e.g., placement of furniture and minor appliances), 3 for a single aspect of the public environment (e.g., correcting bad apostrophes on signs, counting every Ford Americar they see), or 4 for a broad aspect of the public environment (e.g., touching every light post they walk by, hacking into every camera they see).</description>

					<spell name="Armor" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armor equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armor. It is not included in any calculations to determine armor encumbrance (see Armor and Encumbrance, p. 169).</description>

					<spell name="Fix" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F" drainvalue="+0" duration="Permanent" type="Physical" range="Touch" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>Most spellcasters have devoted their efforts towards learning spells rather than mechanics. This can leave a magician in a bad situation when there is a need for an emergency repair during a run. Fix allows the spellcaster to repair damage to non-living materials, including drones and vehicles. The caster must first touch the object and then achieve enough hits to beat the item's Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5).

Fix can repair any item with a weight equal to the Force x the spellcaster's hits in kilograms or less. This spell can only repair broken items when all the pieces are present. The weight limit applies to the damaged part, not necessarily the entire vehicle. For example, if you have a busted wheel, you would count that weight not the weight of the entire vehicle. Each hit scored repairs 1 point of Structure rating or 1 box of damage. An object may only be affected by Fix once and thereafter may not be repaired again by this spell.</description>

					<spell name="Heal" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-4" drainvalue="-4" duration="Permanent" type="Mana" range="Touch" category="Health" subcat="Essence-Dependant Health Spell">
						<description>Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell's hits from the Spellcasting Test. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.</description>

					<spell name="Invisibility" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Mana" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Illusion" subcat="Realistic Illusion Spell,Single-Sense Illusion Spell">
						<description>This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she's good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject's surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</description>

					<spell name="Magic Fingers" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Manipulation" subcat="Physical Manipulation Spell">
						<description>Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect as a sort of invisible hand that can hold or manipulate items. The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell's effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell's Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster's discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the "hands" can't be farther away from each other than your arm span). This spell comes in very handy (no pun intended) for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.</description>

					<spell name="Silence" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-1" drainvalue="-1" duration="Sustained" type="Physical" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Illusion" subcat="Area,Realistic Illusion Spell,Single-Sense Illusion Spell">
						<description>These spells create an area that dampens sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by -1 per hit on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living beings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.</description>

					<spell name="Stabilize" casting="7" drain="9" draintext="F-4" drainvalue="-4" duration="Permanent" type="Mana" range="Touch" category="Health" subcat="">
						<description>When applied to a character with a filled Physical damage track, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell's Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become permanent before the character is truly stabilized; hits reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow (p. 209).</description>

						<description>You learn to change the appearance of your aura (and astral form). You can make it look mundane, or make your Magic Rating look higher or lower by up to your grade. When someone tries to read your masked aura, the Assensing Test becomes opposed by your Magic + initiate grade - if they get any net hits, they see both your mask and your real aura.

If you can use astral perception, you can even make your aura look like a different type (like a spirit or a focus - great for astral costume parties). You can also use this metamagic to mask the auras of as many of your bonded foci as your initiate grade.</description>

								<description>Items that are Custom Fit were measured for a specific person. They are specially designed for that person and don't fit well on anyone else, therefore conferring none of the positive Social Limit adjustments to the character. When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit. The refit process requires an Armorer shop and an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test. The owner can also use their Contacts to help them get the job done, requiring loss of the armor for one week and a payment of 25 percent of the initial armor cost.</description>

								<description>The value and status of simply wearing certain outfits help characters impress those around them, while on the other hand wearing camo fatigues at a social gathering isn't the social standard. Some pieces of armor raise the Social Limit of the wearer. These modifiers do not stack; only the highest modifier of any visible clothing item counts (and "visible" means seeing enough of it that viewers get a solid impression of what the garment does on the wearer. Seeing, for example, only the edge of a cuff poking out from under the sleeve of a battered overcoat or the hem of a dress beneath a housecoat will not provide the modifier). Some increases are limited to certain social circles; those limitations will be listed along with the bonus.</description>

					<item name="Magical Lodge Materials" rating="3" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>A magical lodge is a stationary collection of symbols, writings, tools, fetishes, and other mystical materials that helps spellcasters record their lore, expand their talent, and practice magic. It's a basic tool of magicians across the world, about the size of a room. You need it to learn spells, perform rituals, craft foci, and in a pinch you can use it to protect yourself from magical threats. Each lodge is of a specific tradition - a shamanic lodge is intended for shamans, and a hermetic lodge for mages.

Magical lodges don't always look like lodges per se. A shamanic lodge is a traditional medicine lodge, but a hermetic magician's lodge is a series of magic circles, shelves filled with arcane tomes, mystical mechanisms, and alchemical apparatuses. Every tradition has its own version of a magical lodge, but they all work the same way.

Magical lodges aren't intended to be portable (although you can make a temporary one with reagents, p. 316). To create your own, you need magical lodge materials (they cost Force x 500 nuyen) that are appropriate to your tradition. Once you have the materials, find a space to put it, like your apartment, or a cave in the wilderness, or a secret abandoned sewer tunnel - someplace you won't mind spending some time. Then spend a number of days equal to the lodge's Force dedicating the space, setting up the physical components, building its astral form, setting up barriers, and harmonizing it to your aura. Once you're done, your magical lodge is up and active. An active magical lodge acts as a mana barrier (p. 315) and shares your astral signature.

If you want to move your lodge, you'll need a day to take it down, turning it back into magical lodge materials; then you can set it up again somewhere else. If you want to improve your lodge, just bring in more materials to add to the current ones and spend a day times the Force you want the lodge to have at the end of your work.</description>
