				<attribute name="Body" text="9" base="9" modified="9" naturalmaximum="11" augmentedmaximum="13" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="5/7" base="5" modified="7" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5/7" base="5" modified="7" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="8/10" base="8" modified="10" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="0.51" base="1" modified="0.51" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="4.51" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Biocompatibility (Cyberware)">
						<description>Something about the character's body is exceptionally accepting of either bioware or cyberware implants (choose one). Not only are the implants not rejected, but they seamlessly fit within the body, having less impact on its holistic integrity. In game terms, the Essence cost of implants of the particular chosen type are reduced by ten percent, rounded down to the tenth. This rebate is cumulative with the reduction offered by the chosen 'ware's grade, if any (e.g., the reduction for alphaware of 0.8 is reduced by ten percent, or 0.08, to become 0.72, and is rounded down to 0.7). This quality can only be chosen for bioware or cyberware. This quality may only be taken once.</description>
						<traitcost bp="5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Common Sense">
						<description>"Common sense is not so common" as they say. It's nothing supernatural, just a keen sense of knowing when something is just a bad idea. Any time a character with this quality is about to do something the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must act as their proverbial inner voice of reason and issue a little warning. The gamemaster can only give a number of warnings per session equal to or less than the character's Edge rating. After that, they're on their own.</description>
						<traitcost bp="3"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Goring Horns" useradded="no">
						<description>A single horn or horns express on the character's head. If the character already had horns, these grow even bigger or more pronounced. The horns can be anything from ram horns to deer-like antlers to devil horns or even jagged crests of bone around the skull. Unlike most metatype horns, the character may use these in combat with the Exotic Melee Weapon (Horns) skill. Goring Horns have the following stats: DV (STR + 2)P, Reach - , AP -1.</description>

				</positive>
				<negative>
					<quality name="No Man Left Behind">
						<description>You can’t leave a fallen comrade behind to be taken by the enemy. Whether they are dead or just knocked out, you won’t leave them to the wolves. Any time a team member falls (even one you don’t particularly like), make a Composure (4) Test. Success means you’ve overcome this urge to save your fallen comrade (though you can still do so if you choose); failure means you need to do everything within your power, up to and including self-sacrifice, to get your companion out of the hot zone and to safety.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-7"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Uneducated">
						<description>An Uneducated character is not mentally impaired - she just never had the opportunity to learn. Whether because she and her family were isolated squatters, or were SINless, or otherwise underprivileged, she was denied access to the education system. She has only a rudimentary knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered "unaware" in Technical, Academic Knowledge, and Professional Knowledge skills they do not possess (see Skill Ratings, p. 129), and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. The gamemaster may also require the character to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical sprawl-dweller takes for granted. Additionally, the Karma cost for learning new skills, skill groups or specializations (or for improving existing ones) in these categories is doubled compared to the normal cost (including at character creation), and it’s possible the character will never learn some skill groups belonging to these categories.

This quality increases Notoriety by 1 (p. 372).</description>

					<item name="Bow (Compound)" rating="10" quantity="1" size="Troll Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action (Ready Weapon, p. 165).

Bows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffers a -3 dice pool modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. The weapon's Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow's rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

A compound bow cannot use the Overdraw action due to the nature of the pulley system it uses. The benefit of a compound bow is that the pulley system makes it extremely easy to hold the bow drawn, allowing an archer to maintain a Take Aim action for (Body x 4) Combat Turns. A compound bow can also mount a smartlink, as the pulley system gives the projectiles a fixed velocity.

With any bow or crossbow, a laser sight is ineffective at any range beyond Short due to parabolic nature of the projectiles. Unless you somehow get a laser that also travels in a parabola. Which you can't.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

								<description>Have trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn't have one. But if that's not an option, then try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives your grip a bunch of tiny fibers that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibers can be turned on and off via wireless command if you have a smartgun - if not, pressing two buttons at the same time does the trick. The mod gives a +6 bonus on any tests to see if a character keeps grip on the gun. This can go on any weapon with a grip, whether they have a stock slot or not; if they have a stock slot, this takes it up.</description>

						<description>The Onotari JP-K50 has an unusual past, being originally conceived for the next round of the Euro Wars, which never came about. Or at least, haven't yet. It was shelved for decades, and only recently came back into the production queue during the so-called Dragon Civil War. Able to switch between long-range fire against a single hard armored target (such as a dragon) or firing bursts against clusters (such as drakes), it was seen as a weapon that could be issued to entire squads. Not mass produced, but produced enough that cost trumped quality in many ways, the final result is a sort of super-sized assault rifle rather than the kind of high-quality precision design that Saeder-Krupp is world famous for.</description>

								<description>This stuff looks silly but can save your life. Gel packs look like a bunch of take-out soy sauce packets layered all over your clothes or armor. They come in a variety of colors and can even be custom ordered with different colors in each packet to make a pattern or just add a little flare. The gel hardens for an instant to absorb some of the force of impact but then gets all squishy again if it isn't punctured. If the gel makes contact with air it turns dusty and brittle immediately.

Installed externally, gel packs require no Capacity and increase the Armor Rating of whatever they are added to by 2. Since gel packs solidify for a brief instant, they increase the possibility that the wearer will be knocked down by an attack. When comparing the Physical Limit of a character using armor with gel packs to the DV of an attack to determine knockdown (see Knockdown, p. 194, SR5), lower the character's Physical Limit by 2.</description>

						<description>Max Value: 1,000,000¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

						<description>Sensors are found almost everywhere. Cheaply produced by the billions, miniaturization and integration have made sensors both located everywhere and hard to spot. You can put sensors in just about everything, and lots of people do. Your can of FizzyGoo is watching you and reporting back to marketing. You can play the sensor game, too.

Sensors need to be placed in a housing or case of some sort, or built into another device. Sensors can record data themselves or forward it wirelessly in real-time or as files to other devices. Sensors are available in seven ratings (2-8) and two types: single and array. When you use the sensor array for Perception Tests, you may use your Electronic Warfare skill in place of your Perception skill, and you may use the sensor's Rating as your limit. Sensors can be put into devices that have capacity.

Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats). What you can put your sensor in is limited by the Rating of the sensor (see Sensor Housings table).</description>

Olfactory Booster
This cybersnout enhances, identifies and records smells, and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a whole new world of sensory data to you - you'll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scenthound would. You can smell people's emotions in their sweat (and if applicable, the maker's mark of their tailored pheromones), traces of ammunition propellant, explosives, or biological and chemical warfare compounds - the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odors, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. The olfactory booster can even be used in VR to create an even more immersive experience. Add the booster's rating as a dice pool modifier to your scent-based Perception Tests.</description>

					<item name="Hard Corps Security Uniform XXXXXL" quantity="1" size="Troll Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>One of the biggest troubles runners have is with the uniforms they are required to wear for their disguise and cover story. The details about the uniforms should be exactly right to avoid tipping people off. There are fixers out there that specialize in acquiring uniforms for such jobs (usually fenced to them by runners following successful runs when they picked this stuff up) and selling them to runners. Your fixer may be one of them, or if not, he likely knows someone else who deals in these disguises. Get to know one of these fixers because they can do a lot for you. A truly talented disguise fixer will know precisely what gear you will need to sell the disguise (everything from the actual medical bags and kits that DocWagon medics use and carry around with them to the proper, authorized body armor and restraints used by Lone Star officers). They will know which uniforms wear chevrons and how many years of service each chevron depicts. They will understand the rank system that many medical and law enforcement professionals use, and can tell you how many chevrons your uniform needs if you are trying to pull off the look of a Knight Errant Lieutenant (at least three chevrons, BTW). They will be able to tell you how decorations are meant to be worn, and more importantly, in which order. For those that don’t know, Knight Errant officers wear their decorations over their badges when they are in their uniforms, but not when they are in their full body armor.

These fixers can also provide authentic badges for you to wear on these uniforms. Many law enforcement agencies and corporations still rely on metal badges as a time-honored tradition, though properly encrypted AROs are more common. Either element—the badge or the ID ARO—cannot be simply duplicated by a fashion spell. Most people won’t bother copying the badge number. They have been conditioned by the megacorporations over the years to blindly accept authority in all forms. So even if the badge was taken off a cop that had been killed in the line of duty, it should be sufficient to give you the time to get the job done (provided you don’t pass an observant cop in the hallway leading to your destination who happens to recognize the number).

Knowing the dress codes for each organization is another essential, which any good fixer who specializes in these disguises will know. Knight Errant, for example, has started a new policy of requiring its beat cops to have cyberware with the synthetic coverings installed. So, if you’re pretending to be a Knight Errant cop and you have chrome showing, that could be a big tipoff that you aren’t who you say you are. Lone Star requires its cops to cover up all tattoos and body modifications. This is the information the right fixer can give you.</description>
