					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="1"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="1.23" base="1" modified="1.23" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="5.23" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Friends in High Places">
						<description>"So sorry, Damian, I can't head out on the new Ares prototype ship with you this weekend, I have a run," is something a character with this quality might actually say. This quality gives the character an additional pool of Free Karma for purchasing contacts, with a few stipulations. First, the character gets an additional Charisma x 4 in Karma to purchase contacts. Second, none of these contacts can have a Connection Rating less than 8. Third, any leftover Karma that the character cannot spend is lost. These contacts can't be called at every turn; see the Who You Know chapter for information on what happens if the favors of contacts are abused. (p. 172).</description>
						<traitcost bp="8"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Jack of All Trades, Master of None">
						<description>The character has an incredible aptitude for learning new skills. Unfortunately, the character quickly gets bored and gets turned off when things start getting a little hard. Karma costs are reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for learning skills up to Rating 5. Beyond Rating 5, however, it costs 2 additional points of Karma for each point of skill. This quality does not apply during character creation.</description>
						<traitcost bp="2"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Privileged Family Name">
						<description>With this quality the character's family is exceptionally well-connected, and his real name carries significant clout in his home sprawl (selected at character creation). Though probably known as a rich, spoiled brat, the name (and accompanying SIN and ID) is like a get-out-of-jailfree card for small misdemeanors (such as being caught carrying a weapon, casting an unauthorized mental manipulation spell, or driving a car without a license). Even when trying to act tough, local minor NPCs suffer a -2 dice pool modifier on Social tests against the character. In order to have this quality the character must also possess the SINner (National or Corporate) quality. Remember that this quality also makes the character very easy to identify if those not concerned with their family name start asking questions.</description>
						<traitcost bp="14"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Trust Fund (High &amp; 1,000Â¥/month)" rank="3">
						<description>Everyone knows you're in the shadows for the rush or to fulfill some kind of Batman wannabe fantasy. Every month your trust fund spills out enough to live off, but just living is boring. A character with this quality possesses a lifelong trust fund or inheritance that is managed by another party (a trustee). The quality has four versions depending on just how rich and shady a runner is willing to be. For 5 Karma, the trust fund income covers a Middle lifestyle with 500 nuyen left over each month. For 10 Karma, the income covers a Low Lifestyle but offers the character 2,000 + (3D6 x 100) nuyen each month thanks to a deal with their landlord to rip off the trustee. For 15 Karma, the income covers a High Lifestyle with 1,000 nuyen left over. For 20 Karma, the money covers a Middle Lifestyle and offers 3,000 + (6d6 x 100) nuyen thanks to one of those special deals. The character must also possess the SINner (National or Corporate) quality; additionally, the lifestyle they pay for cannot be paid for through other sources and is part of the records connected to the SIN. None of these lifestyles can be shared on a long-term basis, as the landlords are leery of anyone staying at the place and possibly ruining their deal. Note that there is a chance that if the character is caught breaking the law, the trustee may suspend benefits at the gamemaster's discretion.</description>

					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Mild, Necrophobia" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

					<quality name="SINner (Corporate SIN): Shiawase">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

Corporate SIN At the 25 Karma level is the Corporate Born SIN. The character with this ID was probably born into a mega corporation, or belonged to one when it achieved extraterritoriality. At least one of his parents probably had the Corporate Born SIN as well. He grew up in the corporation, his social involvement, education, and almost every aspect of his life was managed by the corporation. His skills and aptitudes were evaluated constantly, and he was groomed for the career path to which he was best suited; his whole world was the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Born SIN had the potential and the opportunity to advance through the corporation hierarchy. He could have been a department administrator, a finance strategist, an agent of corporate intelligence, an officer in a megacorp's military, or even a member of Corporate Special Forces (Renraku's Red Samurai or Ares' Firewatch). With a Corporate Born SIN, he could have enjoyed top-secret clearance within the corporation and access to nearly unlimited resources. Then something happened. An unforgivably costly mistake, the machinations of a rival, a supervisor in need of a scapegoat - something pushed the character out of the corporation and into the cold and unforgiving shadows. In the shadows a SIN that had been the key to opportunity is now a deadly liability. Most in the shadows see the Corporate Born as the privileged few, the aristocrats in the armored limousines who look down on them, oppress them, exploit them and deny them their basic rights. If the SINless discover the character's Corporate Born SIN, reactions will range from deep suspicion to violent hostility; serious injury and death are real possibilities. The character's loyalty to his corporation is never questioned, which can be an insurmountable liability in a culture that works against the megacorps. Would-be runners have been killed for holding Corporate Born SINs. Fortunately, Corporate Born records are limited to the megacorporation that generated them. Files in the Global SIN Registry can confirm she has a valid SIN, but do not contain any additional information. Those with Corporate Born SINs pay a tax of ten percent of their gross income to their corporation</description>

The user's hearing extends as low as 5 Hz, into infrasonic sound, and as high as 120 kHz into the ultrasonic. This allows the user to hear sounds outside the normal range, such as dog whistles or ultrasound- based motion detectors, which would otherwise go unnoticed. If combined with a device to create such sounds, such as a voice modulator, then a method of signaling, or even communication, can be employed that is difficult for those without the augmentation to listen in on.</description>

									<description>An implanted version of the select sound filter audio enhancement, with the difference that the maximum available Rating is 6 instead of 3.

Select Sound Filter
This lets you block out background noise and focus on specific sounds or patterns of sounds. It even includes speech, word, and sound pattern recognition. Each Rating point lets you select a single sound group (such as the footsteps of a patrolling guard or the rotors of a distant helicopter) and focus on it. You only actively listen to one group at a time, but you can record the others for later playback or set them to triggered monitoring (such as sounding an alert if a conversation brings up a certain topic, or if there's a variation in the breathing pattern of a guard dog).</description>

							<description>An advanced form of the old invoked memory stimulator cyberware, this system features a micro-memory module, a processor, and a dedicated nanohive supporting a specialized neural amplifier colony. Flashback nanites organize themselves into a network of sensors and nanofilaments - similar in many respects to a trode net - over the surface of the user's brain. These probe nanites register neural activity associated with memory formation, backing up the patterns to digital memory. If the subject suffers a brain injury or even simple forgetfulness, the system can access these neural records and stimulate the same neural activity, prompting recall.

You receive the Photographic Memory quality (p. 76, SR5) regarding any experience within the flashback system's storage. These memories are so vivid that it's like viewing a simsense recording of the experience. The system does not store actual memories, just the neural activity map, so the data is useless without your personal brain, and memories may be affected by drugs that inhibit or cause loss of memory.

Photographic Memory
A character with Photographic Memory can instantly recall facts, dates, numbers, or anything else he has seen or heard.

Simrig
This simsense recorder can record experience data (sensory and emotive) from you or whoever is wearing it. Simrig rigs are used to make most of the simsense chips sold on the market. You'll need to have a working sim module (with the DNI interface) to make a recording.</description>

							<description>A nanohive is a nanocybernetic implant designed to support and coordinate nanoware in a living body long-term. Nanohives not only contain the hardware and software necessary to aid the functions of multiple nanoware colonies, but they also provide a safe environment for nanoware systems to repair, replicate, and resupply. As part of nanohive implantation procedures, a host of other minor cybernetic modifications are made to pre-existing organs including the liver, kidneys, and spleen. These alterations keep the body from filtering out nanites like other waste and cellular "detritus." Nanohives themselves replace and repair nanites that are excreted or damaged by the body, maintaining nanite populations at a normal level and even restoring depleted levels after injury. Combined with the filtration systems and the robustness of current nanotech, this limits natural nanite loss.

Each nanohive is a sealed egg-shaped implant containing the primary processor, controllers, and neural interfaces and is implanted near arterial or lymphatic junctions. In addition to the expert system(s), a nanohive incorporates sensors that monitor nanite levels in the blood, as well as reservoirs of feedstocks that support machinery for additional nanite colonies, and several thousand backup nanite units are present in ancillary pods. When the nanoware supported by a nanohive has its Rating reduced, the nanohive returns its Rating by 1 point per week, up to the nanohive's Rating.

Each nanohive supports one nanoware system at a Rating equal to its own.

Hard Nanohive: Hard nanohives are able to communicate and direct the actions of nanoware via shortrange ultrasound, microwave, or UV signals using the nanites themselves as relays. Hard nanohives can use this communication to reprogram the nanite system it supports - its Rating is the number of different hard nanite systems to which it can convert its nanites. Hard nanohives must be restocked every six months at a cost of 500 nuyen x Rating.</description>

							<description>Consisting of a terahertz pulse-transmitter, receiver, and highly advanced processing unit, this unit computes differences in the Doppler shift between the user and the surrounding area, within a twenty-meter radius. This allows the user to view a three-dimensional map of the area and the elements contained therein, if in a vague, blocky manner. The radio pulses are able to pass through most solid matter, allowing the user to "look" through walls, clothes, and similar obstructions to see the outlines of what lies beyond. While individuals cannot be recognized at the resolution of the processing, shapes can give some suggestion of what items might be (tables, guns, balls, and so forth). The system is excellent at detecting motion, calculating exact distance (when combined with a math SPU), and accurately overseeing floorplans and the locations of persons and objects in that area. It is somewhat complex to sift through the data for a proper reading (a Simple Action is required), and while it can ignore Invisibility spells (but not Improved Invisibility spells) and many camouflage methods, it cannot discern color, lighting, or texture.

The radar sensor uses the same Visibility modifiers as ultrasound but can penetrate a cumulative Structure Rating equal to its own Rating x 5. Thus, a Rating 2 radar sensor can penetrate two Rating 5 walls, or a single Rating 10 wall, or three Rating 3 walls, etc. Radar systems are especially vulnerable to jamming and noise, suffering double the usual disruption. Radar pulses are detectable by any wireless device, but most won't be able to identify them as anything more than background noise.</description>

							<description>One of the most-beloved creations of the past five years, the visualizer allows the user to export a 2D or 3D image from their mind to augmented reality, or directly to paper by interfacing with a wireless printer. It requires extensive concentration and rare mental imaging ability to create more than a rough realization of the image in someone's head (use a Memory Test, p. 152, SR5, to determine how many relevant details the individual is able to visualize), but it's an emerging art form. It takes between five seconds (for a simple geometric design) to an hour (for detailed landscapes or persons) to create the image.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

A Rating 1 Extended Clip adds fifty percent more rounds to the gun's capacity, and a Rating 2 Extended Clip adds one hundred percent more rounds. The only downside is it makes a gun a bit harder to hide (+1 Concealability per Rating). More of an accessory than a modification, an Extended Clip does not use any modification slots.</description>

						<description>While armored clothing is effective enough, and armored vests are fairly well hidden, it takes truly advanced craftsmanship to produce form-fitting body armor. Each suit is tailor-made to its wearer, leaving neither gaps nor folds while still allowing the body to breathe. The basic piece of armor is a shirt, covering the body from collarbone to groin, protecting the vital organs, while the full suit adds protection for the limbs. In either case, the hands, feet, and head are left exposed, as covering them gives away the fact that armor is being worn.

Form-fitting body armor can be worn under armor, but doing so won't change your protection much. The primary benefit of FFBA is its highly concealable.</description>

And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn't care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.

I'll admit I loved Manhunt, that remake of the old flatvid with the alien hunting a bunch of mercenaries in the jungle. This stuff makes me think of that trid every time I activate our display. It's high-tech camouflage at its finest. Add this to your favorite outfit and be ready to blend in anywhere.</description>

								<description>I'll admit I loved Manhunt, that remake of the old flatvid with the alien hunting a bunch of mercenaries in the jungle. This stuff makes me think of that trid every time I activate our display. It's high-tech camouflage at its finest. Add this to your favorite outfit and be ready to blend in anywhere.

This modification can be added to any armor or clothing, but it only gains its full benefits when applied to pieces that cover the wearer's whole body, like full body armors or cloaks. The ruthenium polymers are controlled by a sensor suite incorporated into the armor or clothing that scans the surroundings and replicates images of the area at the proper perspectives, helping the wearer blend in. The effectiveness is based on the Rating of the sensor suite and the extent of the suit's coverage. The base modifier to a Perception Test to spot the wearer is - (Rating), adjusted by the extent of the suit; full +0, almost full +1, half +2.</description>

						<description>Max Value: 100,000Â¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

					<item name="Datachip" quantity="10" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Datachip: For occasions when you want to transfer data by physical means - like bringing the project specs on the competition's new cyberdeck to Mr. Johnson in person at the meet - a datachip can hold enormous quantitites of data in a small finger-sized chip, accessible by any electronic device. Datachips have no wireless capability, so you need to plug them into a universal data connector (found on any device) if you want to read or write to them.</description>

					<item name="Linguasoft: English" rating="4" dicepool="0" quantity="1">
						<description>A skillsoft program is a recorded skill - digital knowledge and muscle memory. When used in conjunction with the proper augmentations (a skilljack for knowsofts and linguasofts, and a skillwire system for activesofts) skillsofts let you know and do things you've never otherwise learned. Even kung fu.

Skillsofts aren't educational tools; you can't actually learn from them. They're highly favored by corporations interested in a cheaper labor force (when the difference between a skilled and unskilled worker can be as simple as slotting a chip, the difference in salary is smaller).

When a skill test is called for, the character may use the skillsoft rating in place of the skill. Downside: tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way.

Linguasofts: Linguasofts replicate language skills, allowing a user to speak a foreign language by automatically translating signals from the speech cortex, although chipped speech can be awkward and stilted - then again, so can anyone speaking a language that's not their native tongue. Linguasofts must be accessed with a skilljack, which limits how many skillsofts you can use at a time.</description>

If the patient is bleeding out, the savior's nanites act as a trauma control system (p. 148) for the duration. The savior's supply of nanites is limited, and it must be restocked every time it is used.

Trauma Control System
This nanoware system seeks out and gathers around vital organs. Some component nanites apply electro-stimulation to the heart and respiratory muscles, while others regulate blood flow away from wounds without starving the brain of oxygen. While you're busy dying from overflow damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, the TCS attempts to stabilize you every minute, using its Rating in place of both First Aid and Logic in the Stabilization Test (p. 209, SR5).</description>

The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you've already done plenty of damage).

						<description>A variation of the standard white noise generator, this model is tuned to ultrasonic frequencies. While inaudible to unaugmented metahumans, it is sufficient to blind ultrasound sensors. Each point of Rating adds one die to the user's Sneaking + Agility test to avoid detection via ultrasound systems.</description>

					<item name="White Noise Generator" rating="6" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>This device creates a field of random noise, masking the sounds within its area and preventing direct audio surveillance. All Perception Tests to overhear a conversation within (Rating) meters of a white noise generator receive a negative dice pool modifier equal to the generator's Rating. If more than one generator is in use, only count the highest rating. A white noise generator is redundant in a noisy environment (such as a nightclub or a firefight) and does not help to curtail video surveillance or jam wireless signals.</description>
